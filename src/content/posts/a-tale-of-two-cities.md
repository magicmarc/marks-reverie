# **A Tale of Two Cities**

Australia has two great cities: Sydney and Melbourne.  

As an outsider—and, more recently, a homebound worker who spends long days behind a screen—I can’t claim to know either city in any comprehensive way. What I have are impressions, partial and fleeting, gathered from the edges of living.

## **I. In Sydney, but Dreaming of Melbourne**

If I were to begin with an ending, I’d say this: I live in Sydney, but my heart drifts south to Melbourne.  

Why, I can’t quite explain. It’s not logic but something closer to texture—a quiet dissonance I can’t ignore.  

I first came to Sydney years ago, when I was still living in Brisbane. After a short trip, a friend asked how it was.  
“Wonderful,” I said. “Sydney’s a perfect place to visit—but not for stay.”  

He looked surprised.  

“Sydney feels too much like Hong Kong,” I said. “And one of the reasons I came to Australia was to leave Hong Kong behind.”  

The resemblance was uncanny. Sydney’s skyline, its crowded ferries, the ring of its harbour—all felt like echoes of home. Later I learned that its metro system was built by the same company that built Hong Kong’s. That explained the déjà vu.  

Back then I was speaking sincerely: Sydney, I thought, was a city for workers—or more precisely, for those who could afford to hire them.

## **II. The Grass, the Fence, the Mirror**

Now, years later, I’m writing these lines from a quiet apartment in Sydney. Perhaps what fuels this essay is simple discontent. *The grass is always greener*, as they say, and mine, apparently, grows in Melbourne.  

Why that city, though? Why not Perth, or Adelaide, or somewhere far enough to erase comparison altogether?  

Because, to me, while in Melbourne I could constantly express myself; while in Sydney I am constantly performing for others.  

When I asked my Sydney friends what they thought of Melbourne, their answers came quickly, almost rehearsed.  

“Too many crazies,” said Max. “Sydney’s safer.”  
“No beaches,” said William. “How am I supposed to live without the ocean?”  
“All those lefties,” said Summer. “If my kids grew up there, they’d spend their lives protesting. Sydney’s better for discipline.”  
Jack didn’t even pause. “Bloody outsiders,” he muttered.  

Not a single person wanted to move south here. Not one.

## **III. Two Kinds of Art**

To be fair, their complaints were not without merit.  

Melbourne rains endlessly. The wind howls. The sky refuses to stay the same colour for an hour. There are men on trams who speak to invisible audiences.  

And yet—I prefer it. For one reason: **self-expression.**  

Self-expression gives rise to a kind of artistry that feels uniquely Melbourne. The city hums with small, unguarded acts of creativity: independent bookstores spilling poetry onto the sidewalks, cafés perfumed with espresso and quiet ambition, buskers whose voices echo between tram bells and drizzle. There’s always something happening just around the corner—someone sketching, someone singing, someone talking too loudly about a book that changed their life.

Melbourne dresses like no one is watching—an effortless collision of colours and textures, thrift-store coats paired with confidence. Its people speak with a clarity that feels almost rehearsed, as if every word has been weighed and chosen, polished until it catches the light. Conversations are animated but sincere; they listen as much as they perform.

And there’s a certain social grace here, an openness rare in other cities. Strangers become companions over a single cup of coffee; introductions dissolve into friendships before you realise it. Every time I visit Melbourne, I meet someone new—someone who paints, writes, plays, dreams. This, I think, is the spirit I once naively called “artsy.” Perhaps I still do.

Sydney, of course, has art in abundance—an opera house that gleams like a seashell, galleries and museums of every scale, international orchestras, film festivals, pop stars. If culture is an industry, Sydney is its boardroom. It curates beauty the way corporations curate vision statements: sleek, precise, always ready for a press release. The city celebrates excellence, but it does so with the distant polish of a glass tower—spectacular, professional, and faintly impersonal. You buy your ticket, take your seat, and admire from the correct distance. The art dazzles, but you rarely touch it.

Melbourne, on the other hand, feels like the back room of that same building—messy, alive, a little improvised. Art here isn’t performed for you; it happens around you. In Sydney, art demands a ticket; in Melbourne, it demands attention. Sydney wants to impress you; Melbourne wants to include you. 

It’s the same distinction one might draw between Los Angeles and New York.
Hollywood lives in L.A.; Broadway lives in New York.
Both belong to the same constellation of art, yet they burn at different temperatures.

Film, to me, feels like a constellation you can only admire from afar—magnificent, but untouchable. It demands capital, coordination, and an army of professionals. Every frame is polished, every silence edited. You sit in the dark, passive, a spectator to someone else’s dream.

Theatre, by contrast, feels like standing too close to a fire. The actors breathe the same air as you; their sweat and trembling are real, not simulated. A single stumble, a missed line, can alter the night’s chemistry. The play unfolds not on stage alone but between performer and audience—an invisible current that makes everyone complicit. You don’t just watch it; it happens to you.

Film is spectacle; theatre is collision.
Film entertains; theatre implicates.

And perhaps that’s why I love it—because theatre breaks the fourth wall not as a trick, but as an invitation. For a few hours, you’re no longer an observer; you’re part of the story. 

And perhaps that’s the point: art, at its best, is not display—it’s dialogue.

## **IV. Art and Capital, Uneasy Allies**

If I were a performer, I suspect I’d be happier in New York than Los Angeles.  
But that, too, might be projection. The cities themselves are not opposites—just different dialects of the same hunger.  

A small play, if it succeeds, may one day become a film. That’s not corruption; it’s evolution.  
Art, like water, changes shape according to its container.  

Collaboration, compromise—these are not betrayals but necessities.  
A monologue with no audience is not art; it’s a man muttering to himself on a Melbourne tram.  

Every artist must negotiate with the world. Some deals work; some don’t. The trick is to find the ecosystem where your voice can breathe.

## **V. Sydney and Melbourne: The Twin Engines**

And so we circle back: Sydney and Melbourne are not adversaries. They are, like art and life, parts of the same system.  

In Melbourne, you can spend twenty dollars to see a small, experimental show—sometimes even free, with a donation jar passed around at the end.  
In Sydney, a single night at the Opera House can cost two hundred.  

Melbourne invites participation; Sydney commands reverence.  
Both, in their own ways, are essential.  

Without Sydney’s infrastructure, professionalism, and audience, few artists could make a living.  
Without Melbourne’s raw, unpolished energy, art would lose its pulse.  

So here’s the balance I’ve come to accept:  
> In Sydney, art is a career. In Melbourne, art is a way of life.  

Too much of Melbourne’s “life” and art dissolves into self-indulgence—the bus of muttering prophets and overzealous children.  
Too much of Sydney’s “career” and art calcifies into spectacle—technically perfect, emotionally sterile.  

Good art lives somewhere between the two: grounded yet free, personal yet public.  
To express oneself honestly while still listening—that, I think, is the secret.

## **VI. The Middle Path**

In Chinese philosophy, we call this balance *zhongyong*—the “Doctrine of the Mean.”  
But there’s nothing mediocre about it. Balance is not compromise; it’s precision.  

A person needs both a career and a life.  
Both the scaffolding of work and the softness of being.  

At work, we should remember that colleagues are not machines.  
In life, we should remember that even friendships have their economies.  

Sydney and Melbourne, then, are not so far apart.  
One makes you look upward; the other teaches you to breathe.  

And somewhere in that rhythm—between the skyline and the rain—I hope to find my own footing.
