# A Wedding at Olinda Teahouse

At first, the air was pure reverence. The violinist’s bow drew out the sacred notes of the wedding march, the guests hushed, backs straight, and even the wind seemed to hold its breath. 

Then - **zap!!** -  the solemn air was sliced apart, as if by an electric blade. The violin lit up in flashing neon, and the melody lurched into a thunderous, modern riff. Taylor Swift’s *Love Story* exploded from the strings, part rock concert, part wedding anthem.

Gasps turned to laughter, and the crowd blinked in disbelief. Just then, **Sarah**, without missing a beat, slid on a pair of mirrored sunglasses, reached beneath her chair, and ignited a glowing Star Wars lightsaber. The humming blade cast a blue sheen across her white dress.

The guests erupted. A few children jumped up, cheering, “Jedi bride! Jedi bride!” Sarah raised the saber skyward like a rock star summoning her audience, then began waving it in time with the music. Within seconds she had half the room clapping and singing, transforming the ceremony into a full-blown festival.

**Ray**, standing calmly beside her, smirked at the spectacle. "I suppose physics has nothing on *Love Story*." And with that, even he cracked a grin, the pragmatic groom swept into the chaos of Sarah’s galaxy.

That was Sarah: open-hearted, instantly warm. And there was Ray: witty, pragmatic, making sure everything held together—yet never missing the chance to deliver a perfectly timed quip.

## Brina and Michael

Brina and Michael had gathered a small circle of guests near the dining table. Brina was in full flow, demonstrating a climbing move with her hands, twisting her body as if an invisible bouldering wall were right in front of her.

“And then - you have to dyno to the top hold like this!” she exclaimed, leaping half a step. “It’s exactly like when Naruto powers up - pure determination!”

The group laughed, and all eyes turned to Michael. Tall, steady, quietly smiling, he finally added just one line in his calm voice:

“Except in real life, you fall. A lot.”

The timing was perfect. Everyone burst out laughing, Brina included. It was them in a nutshell: she, the spark and the storyteller; he, the quiet anchor whose rare comments landed with unexpected humour. Together they were a picture of contrasts, bound by anime marathons, bouldering weekends, and their own rhythm.  

## Gracie and Walter

Further along, Gracie and Walter lingered at the dessert table. They weren’t loud, but when they smiled, it was warm and genuine, like an old friend’s embrace. 

Walter, tall and solid, studied the pastries with surprising care. Gracie, small and bright-eyed, leaned in beside him.  

"The pâte à choux has collapsed a little," Gracie murmured.  

"And the ganache...un peu trop liquide," Walter replied gravely.  

I blinked. "The what?"  

They both laughed, instantly explaining. 

Their shared love of baking meant they slipped into French pastry terms without noticing. It struck me then: she, a Brisbane native who had followed Walter to Vancouver; he, a Canadian with a quiet presence. 

They spoke softly, but their connection was unmistakable - woven from flour, sugar, and a language of their own.  

## The Speech

When it came time for Sarah’s father to speak, it quickly became clear he had celebrated a bit too generously beforehand. His words tangled together, sentences wandering like tipsy footsteps. Laughter rippled through the crowd.  

Her brother quietly stepped up, steadying both his father and the microphone. Together they navigated the speech - half sincere, half comedic duet. Every stumble was met with a cheer, and by the end, the whole room was laughing and clapping. It felt less like a formality and more like a family moment, utterly endearing.  

## The Dance Floor

Steph was well past tipsy, swaying dramatically with her arms in the air, then suddenly dropping to the floor with a flourish. She rolled onto her back, giggling uncontrollably, and announced, “Look at me! I’m spinning, I’m the disco ball!”

Sarah’s eyes lit up; she crouched beside Steph, clapping her hands in delight. “This is perfect—you are the disco ball!” she laughed. “All we need now is *ABBA*!”

Right on cue, Dancing Queen roared through the speakers. The dance floor erupted into cheers. Brina tugged Michael into the circle, Gracie and Walter joined with easy smiles, and even Ray was swept along. 

He threw in an exaggerated twirl and called out: “Careful, folks—if I spin any faster, we’ll need peer review!”

## Me

I stood back, half amused, half moved. These weren’t random quirks: Sarah embracing strangers, Ray balancing humour with order; Brina giving voice to Michael’s gentle quiet; Gracie and Walter carrying their soft rhythm across continents.  

It made me wonder: do ideal partners mirror us, or complete us? Looking around, I realised the beauty wasn’t in symmetry but in contrast: how laughter and reason, boldness and shyness, warmth and steadiness came together to form a whole.  

For the first time, a wedding didn’t feel like a performance. It felt like life itself.

Later in the evening, Sarah’s mum leaned over to me with a smile and said, almost teasingly, “You’re so quiet, it’s frightening.”

Ray, quick as ever, added with a laugh, “The trick is you’ve got to poke him, *really poke him*, if you want any information at all.”

And maybe they were right. I don’t always speak much. In writing, I give back what silence kept.
