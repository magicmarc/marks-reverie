# A Wedding at Olinda Teahouse

At Olinda Teahouse, the ceremony began not with solemn chords, but with the violinist suddenly playing Taylor Swift.  

Ray leaned towards Sarah, smirking.  

"Not on the schedule, but I suppose physics has nothing on *Love Story*."  

Sarah, radiant and utterly at ease, clapped along and waved at the crowd. She even hugged a waitress as if they were lifelong friends. 

That was Sarah: open-hearted, instantly warm. And there was Ray: witty, pragmatic, quietly making sure everything held together, yet never missing a chance for a joke.  

## Brina and Michael

By the canapé table, Brina crouched with a canapé in hand, coaxing the resident peacock closer.  
"Look, Michael, he likes you!"  

Michael, tall and broad-shouldered, shifted nervously.  
"I think he's, um… charging."  

His voice was unexpectedly soft, almost apologetic. The bird fanned its feathers, and Brina stepped forward, laughing.  
"Don't mind him—Michael's too gentle to shoo it away."  

It was classic them: Brina speaking for two, lively and outward, while Michael stood as the quiet anchor—gentle, patient, and steady. Together they were a picture of contrasts, bound by anime marathons, bouldering weekends, and shared research projects.  

## Gracie and Walter

Further along, Gracie and Walter lingered at the dessert table. They weren’t loud, but when they smiled, it was warm and genuine, like an old friend’s embrace. Walter, tall and solid, studied the pastries with surprising care. Gracie, small and bright-eyed, leaned in beside him.  

"The pâte à choux has collapsed a little," Gracie murmured.  
"And the ganache—un peu trop liquide," Walter replied gravely.  

I blinked.  
"The what?"  

They both laughed, instantly explaining. Their shared love of baking meant they slipped into French pastry terms without noticing. It struck me then: she, a Brisbane native who had followed Walter to Vancouver; he, a Canadian with a quiet presence. They spoke softly, but their connection was unmistakable—woven from flour, sugar, and a language of their own.  


## The Dance Floor

Then came Steph, tipsy and sprawling on the floor.  
"I'm the disco ball!"  

Sarah dropped down beside her, giggling.  
"Perfect! Don't move—we just need ABBA."  

Cue *Dancing Queen*. The floor erupted. Brina dragged a blushing Michael into the circle; Walter shuffled with surprising grace, Gracie laughing beside him. Even Ray joined in, quipping mid-spin:  
"Newton never said anything about standing still."  


## Reflection

I stood back, half amused, half moved. These weren’t random quirks: Sarah embracing strangers, Ray balancing humour with order; Brina giving voice to Michael’s gentle quiet; Gracie and Walter carrying their soft rhythm across continents.  

It made me wonder: do ideal partners mirror us, or complete us? Looking around, I realised the beauty wasn’t in symmetry but in contrast—how laughter and reason, boldness and shyness, warmth and steadiness came together to form a whole.  

For the first time, a wedding didn’t feel like a performance. It felt like life itself, distilled into joy.
