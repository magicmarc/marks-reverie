# Act V — *Wai and the Lighthouse*  

## Scene 1: The Coastal Walk  

*(Sydney coastline. The four flatmates trudge along a sandy bush track under the blazing sun. Waves crash below; cicadas scream overhead.)*  

**MARK** *(panting)*:  
Whose idea was this? Coastal walk, my foot—this is coastal death march.  

**AMBER** *(cheerfully cruel)*:  
Mine. Builds character. And leg muscles. You three could use both.  

**WAI** *(lagging behind, fanning himself with his cap)*:  
Character’s overrated. What I need is an ice cream truck. Or a stretcher.  

**WILL** *(smirking, still immaculate)*:  
You’re the athlete, remember? If you collapse first, it’ll be embarrassing for all of us.  

*(They laugh, trudging on. None notice Wai slowing, turning his gaze to the distant lighthouse, its white tower shimmering in the heat. His backpack shifts; inside, an unfamiliar book’s cover peeks—*The Southern Cross*, with a beast sprouting blossoms. He had taken it earlier from Will’s shelf, fascinated by its cover art.)*  

*(As the others vanish around a bend, Wai pauses, drawn. He trudges alone towards the lighthouse.)*

## Scene 2: The Lighthouse  

*(The lighthouse door groans open. Inside, shadows crawl. The walls pulse, sprouting grotesque tendrils tipped with flowers. The air smells of salt and pollen. Wai staggers back.)*  

**WAI** *(yelling)*:  
Nope. Nope. Big nope.  

*(He bolts outside—but the world has changed. The sky glows violet, the sea churns emerald. Strange figures drift inside translucent bubbles—explorers with sextants, sailors, and one massive creature with coral sprouting from its back, eyes like lanterns.)*  

**CREATURE** *(voice like whale-song)*:  
You are not of this tide. Why do you run?  

**WAI** *(gaping, then blurting)*:  
Because walls aren’t supposed to grow tentacles! And who are you—Finding Nemo’s nightmare cousin?  

*(The creature hums, amused. A bubble drifts down; inside is a weathered **EXPLORER** with sunburnt skin and gentle eyes.)*  

**EXPLORER:**  
Fear not. You’ve stepped into the bubble of the Southern Cross. Here, nature remembers itself. The land, the sea, the sky—untouched, eternal.  

**WAI** *(scratching his head)*:  
So… this is like… paradise? Looks a bit mouldy.  

**EXPLORER** *(smiling faintly)*:  
Paradise to some. A warning to others. You humans tear at the world too fast. Perhaps the bubble shows what is lost—or what could be, if you listened.  

**CREATURE:**  
The earth endures without you. The question is—do you endure without it?  

*(Wai stares, speechless. For once, no joke rises to his lips. He takes a shaky breath.)*

## Scene 3: The Temptation  

*(Wai stumbles back into the lighthouse. At its heart is a radiant light, pure and beckoning. He squints, raising a hand to shield his eyes. The voice of the light thrums inside his chest, promising unity, peace, timelessness.)*  

*(The chamber shifts around him. The floor becomes glassy water; reflections ripple and solidify into images—wars raging on TV screens, choking smoke above cities, oil slicks smothering seas. The hum of the light becomes a chorus of newscasters, protests, sirens. Wai clutches his ears, but the sound is inside him.)*  

**WAI** *(hoarse, muttering)*:  
The world’s a bloody mess… Politics tearing people apart, cities choking on their own fumes. Everyone rushing, never breathing. Maybe this bubble’s the way out.  

*(The light shimmers. Out of it steps another Wai—an apparition, sharper, calmer, radiant with the glow of the lighthouse itself. His twin smiles knowingly.)*  

**OTHER WAI:**  
Why go back? Out there you’re just noise, a joker with a tennis racket. Here you can be pure—part of something vast, untainted. No smog, no bills, no pretending you like the city’s grind. Just nature, eternal and clean.  

**WAI** *(hesitant, swallowing hard)*:  
I do hate the city. Hate the traffic, the screens, the rush. I’ve always wanted the bush, the sea… a place where air actually tastes like air.  

**OTHER WAI** *(stepping closer, coaxing)*:  
Then join me. Merge with the light. Leave behind their shouting, their endless appetite. Here you are whole. Here, no one laughs at you.  

*(Wai trembles. For a moment, the glow tempts him, promising release. He sees himself running free across meadows, diving into turquoise waters, never trapped again by deadlines or apartments.)*  

*(But then another memory hits: Amber’s voice, scolding him even as she covers him with a blanket after training too hard. Will’s smirk on the tennis court—“rematch next week, don’t you dare flake.” Mark’s awkward grin as he fixes Wai’s tangled shoelaces with neat precision, muttering but never truly angry. The warmth of being needed, of belonging, even in chaos.)*  

**WAI** *(voice breaking)*:  
No… No, this isn’t it. Paradise that asks you to quit isn’t paradise. If I want clean air, I’ll fight for it in Sydney. If I want peace, I’ll carve it with my own hands, not hide in some bubble.  

*(The apparition falters, its glow flickering. The Other Wai sneers, then dissolves back into the light. Suddenly the walls begin to shudder. Cracks streak across the stone like lightning. Flowering tendrils wither into ash. The great beam of the lighthouse flares, blinding white, then fractures into shards of light that rain down like broken glass.)*  

*(Wai shields his face as the whole tower convulses. The floor splits, seawater gushes through, the spiral stairs twist and collapse. Outside, the sky itself buckles—the violet fades, the emerald sea drains of colour. The world of the bubble is dying with his refusal.)*  

*(With a thunderous roar, the lighthouse implodes into a whirl of salt spray and petals. When the light clears, Wai is hurled out onto the sand, coughing, clothes soaked, the ordinary ocean roaring behind him. The lighthouse is gone, leaving only an empty headland.)*  

**WAI** *(on his knees, whispering, breathless but resolute)*:  
No more running. The world’s messy—but it’s mine. And I’ll fight to make it better.  


## Scene 4: Reunion  

*(Moments later. The others appear around the bend, calling his name. Amber looks ready to kill him, Mark panicked, Will calmly annoyed.)*  

**AMBER** *(storming up)*:  
Where the hell did you wander off to, you muppet? I nearly filed a missing persons report.  

**WAI** *(forcing a grin, still pale)*:  
Took the scenic route. Saw a few things. Maybe too many.  

*(They walk together toward the lighthouse cliff. Wai pauses, staring at the ocean spread beneath—the blinding blue, the endless sky, the green bushlands swaying.)*  

**WAI** *(quietly, almost to himself)*:  
You know… we live too fast. Chase too much. And all this—(he gestures at the sea, the headlands, the sky)—we barely even look at it. Maybe the world’s already giving us paradise, and we’re just too stupid to notice.  

*(The others fall silent. Even Amber doesn’t quip. For a moment, they all stand there, letting the surf and sky wash over them. Four friends, one cliff, and a rare, unhurried pause.)*
