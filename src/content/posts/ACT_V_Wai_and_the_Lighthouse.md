# Act V — *Wai and the Lighthouse*  

## Scene 1: The Coastal Walk  

*(Sydney coastline. The four flatmates trudge along a sandy bush track under the blazing sun. Waves crash below; cicadas scream overhead.)*  

**MARK** *(panting)*:  
Whose idea was this? Coastal walk, my foot—this is coastal death march.  

**AMBER** *(cheerfully cruel)*:  
Mine. Builds character. And leg muscles. You three could use both.  

**WAI** *(lagging behind, fanning himself with his cap)*:  
Character’s overrated. What I need is an ice cream truck. Or a stretcher.  

**WILL** *(smirking, still immaculate)*:  
You’re the athlete, remember? If you collapse first, it’ll be embarrassing for all of us.  

*(They laugh, trudging on. None notice Wai slowing, turning his gaze to the distant lighthouse, its white tower shimmering in the heat. His backpack shifts; inside, an unfamiliar book’s cover peeks—*The Southern Cross*, with a beast sprouting blossoms. He had taken it earlier from Will’s shelf, fascinated by its cover art.)*  

*(As the others vanish around a bend, Wai pauses, drawn. He trudges alone towards the lighthouse.)*

## Scene 2: The Lighthouse  

*(The lighthouse door groans open. Inside, shadows crawl. The walls pulse, sprouting grotesque tendrils tipped with flowers. The air smells of salt and pollen. Wai staggers back.)*  

**WAI** *(yelling)*:  
Nope. Nope. Big nope.  

*(He bolts outside—but the world has changed. The sky glows violet, the sea churns emerald. Strange figures drift inside translucent bubbles—explorers with sextants, sailors, and one massive creature with coral sprouting from its back, eyes like lanterns.)*  

**CREATURE** *(voice like whale-song)*:  
You are not of this tide. Why do you run?  

**WAI** *(gaping, then blurting)*:  
Because walls aren’t supposed to grow tentacles! And who are you—Finding Nemo’s nightmare cousin?  

*(The creature hums, amused. A bubble drifts down; inside is a weathered **EXPLORER** with sunburnt skin and gentle eyes.)*  

**EXPLORER:**  
Fear not. You’ve stepped into the bubble of the Southern Cross. Here, nature remembers itself. The land, the sea, the sky—untouched, eternal.  

**WAI** *(scratching his head)*:  
So… this is like… paradise? Looks a bit mouldy.  

**EXPLORER** *(smiling faintly)*:  
Paradise to some. A warning to others. You humans tear at the world too fast. Perhaps the bubble shows what is lost—or what could be, if you listened.  

**CREATURE:**  
The earth endures without you. The question is—do you endure without it?  

*(Wai stares, speechless. For once, no joke rises to his lips. He takes a shaky breath.)*  

**WAI:**  
Maybe you’re right. Maybe we’re the rot, not the roots.

## Scene 3: The Temptation  

*(Wai stumbles back into the lighthouse. At its heart is a radiant light, pure and beckoning. He squints, raising a hand to shield his eyes. The voice of the light thrums inside his chest, promising unity, peace, timelessness.)*  

*(He takes a step closer. And another. Just as he reaches out, memories crash through him—Amber’s sharp voice calling him an idiot, the sting of her cushion smacks; Will’s easy grin on the tennis court, the promise of a rematch; Mark’s awkward laughter, his precise care that somehow always included Wai’s chaos.)*  

**WAI** *(hoarse, whispering)*:  
…Damn it. I can’t. Not yet. They’d never let me live it down.  

*(He backs away, stumbling, until the light fades and the ordinary world roars back—wind, sea spray, cicadas. The lighthouse door slams shut. Wai falls to his knees in the sand, panting.)*

## Scene 4: Reunion  

*(Moments later. The others appear around the bend, calling his name. Amber looks ready to kill him, Mark panicked, Will calmly annoyed.)*  

**AMBER** *(storming up)*:  
Where the hell did you wander off to, you muppet? I nearly filed a missing persons report.  

**WAI** *(forcing a grin, still pale)*:  
Took the scenic route. Saw a few things. Maybe too many.  

*(They walk together toward the lighthouse cliff. Wai pauses, staring at the ocean spread beneath—the blinding blue, the endless sky, the green bushlands swaying.)*  

**WAI** *(quietly, almost to himself)*:  
You know… we live too fast. Chase too much. And all this—(he gestures at the sea, the headlands, the sky)—we barely even look at it. Maybe the world’s already giving us paradise, and we’re just too stupid to notice.  

*(The others fall silent. Even Amber doesn’t quip. For a moment, they all stand there, letting the surf and sky wash over them. Four friends, one cliff, and a rare, unhurried pause.)*
