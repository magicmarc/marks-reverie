## Scene: Same flat, later that evening

Amber sprawled on the sofa with wine, Wai scrolling his phone, Mark dutifully stacking plates. Will in his room arranging books.

**WILL** *(casual, almost too casual)*:  
Mark, can you come here for a second? I need you to lift the bookcase for me.

**MARK** *(suspicious)*:  
What am I, your intern?

**AMBER** *(snorting)*:  
Don’t argue, Mark. You’re built for errands.

*(Mark mutters but heads into the bedroom. He pauses at the looming bookcase.)*

**MARK** *(eyeing the rows of spines)*:  
You've got every English novel they tortured us with at school. Dickens, Austen, Brontë… Did you mug a library?

**WILL** *(smiling faintly)*:  
Hardly. They found me.

**MARK** *(snorts)*:  
What are you, a book whisperer?

**WILL** *(steps closer, pulling out a battered copy of Pride and Prejudice)*:  
Something like that. Want to see what makes these more than paper?

**MARK** *(hesitating)*:  
If this is some elaborate sales pitch for a book club, I'm not interested.

*(Will opens the book. The pages flutter as though caught in a sudden breeze. The lights flicker. Mark blinks—when he opens his eyes, he’s standing in a sunlit country lane, birdsong in the air. He looks down at himself, horrified to see a stiff Regency suit and absurd cravat.)*

**MARK:**  
Oh no. Absolutely not. I look like I've been mugged by a curtain shop.

**WILL** *(immaculate in his Regency attire, bowing with mock elegance)*:  
On the contrary—you're perfect. A moody stranger, awkward in company. You'll fit right in.

**MARK** *(spluttering)*:  
This is Pride and Prejudice? Seriously?

*(A group of ladies in bonnets walk past, whispering behind their fans. One titters. Elizabeth Bennet herself pauses, giving Mark a long, appraising look.)*

**ELIZABETH** *(archly)*:  
A pleasure, sir. Though you look rather… unsettled.

**MARK** *(stammering a bow, almost tripping over his coat)*:  
I—I'm perfectly fine. Entirely fine.

**ELIZABETH** *(smiles knowingly)*:  
Mm. We shall see.

*(She glides away.)*

**MARK** *(hissing)*:  
She knows! She knows I don't belong!

**WILL** *(teasing, voice low)*:  
They always know. That's the fun.

*(Mr Collins suddenly barrels over, pompous and breathless.)*

**MR COLLINS:**  
Sir! Sir! You must join us at the assembly this evening! Such a rare honour, a new gentleman in our midst!

**MARK** *(alarmed)*:  
Assembly? As in… public gathering? Dancing? No... absolutely not...

**MR COLLINS** *(ignoring him, grabbing his arm)*:  
It is settled. Lady Catherine shall be most gratified.

*(Mark is half-dragged towards the lights of a nearby hall. Will strolls behind, hands clasped behind his back, watching with an infuriating smile.)*

**WILL** *(calling after him)*:  
Relax, Mark. Think of it as… social research.

**MARK** *(groaning)*:  
This is going to be a disaster.

*(They disappear into the candlelit building, music already spilling out.)*

## Scene: A grand assembly room in Meryton

Candles glitter. Musicians tune fiddles. The Bennet sisters are radiant; the local gentry mill about. Mark, still in his ridiculous cravat, is shoved through the door beside Will, who looks utterly at home in Regency finery.

**MARK** *(muttering under his breath)*:  
This is absurd. I can't dance. I haven't danced since… well, since an office Christmas party best forgotten.

**WILL** *(smiling wickedly, voice low)*:  
You'll manage. Just follow my lead. Or better yet—don't step on anyone's toes.

*(Elizabeth Bennet approaches, graceful and amused.)*

**ELIZABETH** *(curtseying)*:  
Mr Mark, is it? You look positively petrified. Do not worry; no one here bites. Well, except perhaps Lady Catherine.

**MARK** *(flustered, fumbling a bow)*:  
I—I'm fine. Entirely composed.

*(Behind him, Will smirks. Elizabeth suppresses a laugh and drifts away.)*

*(The musicians strike up. Mr Collins lumbers forward, puffing with self-importance.)*

**MR COLLINS:**  
Sir! A gentleman must not linger at the edges. You must join the dance! Come, I shall escort you.

**MARK** *(horrified)*:  
Oh no, really, I—

**MR COLLINS** *(dragging him by the arm)*:  
Nonsense! You are precisely the height Lady Catherine admires in a partner.

*(Mark is shoved into a line of dancers. The music begins. He stumbles immediately, nearly toppling into Lydia Bennet, who shrieks with laughter.)*

**LYDIA:**  
Careful, sir! One might think you'd never seen a dance floor before.

**MARK** *(muttering)*:  
Not one like this…

*(He tries to follow the steps, fails miserably, and collides with Jane, who smiles kindly despite the pain in her toes.)*

**JANE** *(gentle)*:  
It is quite alright. The floor is crowded.

**MARK** *(mortified)*:  
I've just assaulted half the Bennet family. Wonderful.

*(Will finally intervenes, stepping into the dance with perfect poise. He catches Mark's hand firmly, guiding him into the steps. Their eyes lock. For a moment the crowd blurs away.)*

**WILL** *(low, with that dangerous smile)*:  
Relax, Mark. You're mine to steady.

**MARK** *(flushes, stammering)*:  
I—I didn't ask—

**WILL** *(cutting in, voice sharp but soft)*:  
You never do. That's why you need me.

*(Mark trips again, this time into Will's chest. Will holds him steady, unyielding, while the dancers whirl around them. From the sidelines, Elizabeth and Charlotte exchange knowing looks, whispering.)*

**CHARLOTTE** *(to Elizabeth)*:  
There is something peculiar about those two.

**ELIZABETH** *(smirking)*:  
Oh, decidedly peculiar. But entertaining.

*(The dance ends in chaos—Mark breathless, Will immaculate. Mr Collins claps approvingly, entirely missing the tension.)*

**MR COLLINS:**  
Splendid! Lady Catherine shall be most impressed.

**MARK** *(to Will, muttering furiously)*:  
You did that on purpose.

**WILL** *(leaning close, eyes glinting)*:  
Of course I did. Watching you unravel is the highlight of my evening.

*(Mark glares, but he's trembling—not entirely from embarrassment. The candles flicker; for an instant, it feels as though the whole ballroom is watching them a little too closely, as if the story itself has noticed the intrusion.)*

**MARK** *(whispering)*:  
Get me out of here.

**WILL** *(smile wicked, tilting his head)*:  
Not until I've had my fill.

*(Mark’s chest tightens. He is under so many eyes. His first time wondering if his steps are wrong, if he’s misjudging the etiquette, if every misstep screams “fraud” to an audience drawn from history books he never read properly. Heat floods his face. He can’t breathe. He bolts.)*

**MARK** *(panicked, stumbling through the crowd)*:  
Excuse me—sorry—pardon—

*(He breaks from the dancers, pushing into the garden. Lanterns cast a dim glow. He stumbles backwards, words of the novel's world buzzing in his head—cotillions, propriety, Darcy, duty—until his heel catches the edge of a stone pool. With a splash, he tumbles in.)*

**MARK** *(spluttering, furious and mortified)*:  
Perfect. Absolutely perfect. My grand Regency debut ends in a pond.

*(Will appears at the pool's edge, maddeningly dry and composed, crouching with a wry smile.)*

**WILL** *(smooth, mocking)*:  
You really are determined to drown tonight, aren’t you?

*(He reaches in, grips Mark's wrist firmly, and hauls him out. Mark coughs, drenched and humiliated, collapsing against Will's chest. Will's smile fades, his tone dropping into command.)*

**WILL**:  
Enough. Time to go home.

*(He snaps the book shut. The ballroom vanishes—the candles, the music, the cold water—all gone. Mark blinks, gasping, as reality floods back: same flat, the sofa, Amber and Wai staring. He stands dripping in the doorway, caught between worlds.)*

## Scene: Same flat, seconds later

**AMBER** *(frowning)*:  
What happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost—or worse, a tax return.

**WAI** *(laughing, pointing a fork at him)*:  
Mate, did you pass out in there? Your hair's a crime scene.

**MARK** *(hesitant, voice unsteady)*:  
I—I was just—

*(He cuts himself short, eyes flicking towards Will. Will is calmly pouring more wine into Amber’s glass, utterly composed.)*

**WILL** *(light, easy tone)*:  
We were just talking about nursery chaos. One of the kids tried to smuggle a frog in their lunchbox today. Thought it was hilarious.

**AMBER** *(snorting)*:  
Adorable? That's nightmare fuel.

**WAI** *(grinning, kicking back on the sofa)*:  
Still less messy than Amber's cooking.

**AMBER** *(swatting at him with a cushion)*:  
Oi! At least mine's edible, unlike your protein shake sludge.

*(Amber and Wai break into familiar bickering. The room fills with laughter. Mark stands apart, still shaken, eyes locked on Will. Finally, Will glances back, his expression soft for the others but razor-sharp for Mark. For a heartbeat, Mark sees the same dangerous glint from the ballroom. Then Will looks away, joining in Amber and Wai’s laughter as if nothing had happened.)*

*(Mark presses a hand to the doorframe, silent. The sound of laughter washes around him, warm and ordinary, yet he feels the bookcase watching from the shadows of the next room.)*
