# Inbetweeners: Dorian & Stevens  

There are mornings when I sit before my computer, the IDE casting its pale glow across the screen. As I trace each line of code with meticulous care, I suddenly feel a fissure opening within me.  

My engineering work tolerates no looseness: every bracket aligned, every query flawless, every action justified. It calls for logical clarity, swift execution, and results that can be counted in commercial value. Efficiency here is not virtue but obligation; precision is the price of survival.  

Yet when I cross the threshold into writing, I become another creature entirely. Words tumble from me like leaves in a storm; I circle around ideas, chatter like a drunkard in a tavern, inventing stories that dissolve even as I commit them to paper. Here, I am as unlike my work-bound self as Dorian Gray is unlike the painted portrait he hides in the attic.   

The pull between these two selves often leaves me stranded in uncertainty. Which of them is the true “I”? Am I the meticulous engineer, who finds security in clarity, or the feverish dreamer, whose imagination knows no bounds? At times I fear I am neither, but merely the empty corridor between them.  

It was *The Picture of Dorian Gray* that first gave shape to this unease. I think of Basil Hallward, whose devotion to art is tempered by his grasp of reality; of Sibyl Vane, who loses her artistic brilliance the moment she dreams of ordinary love; and of Lord Henry, who intoxicates Dorian with his philosophies of pleasure while contributing nothing of substance himself. Wilde shows how beauty, when pursued as performance alone, drifts fatally away from life. In Sibyl’s decline, I see the cost of forsaking one’s craft; in Dorian’s corruption, the ruin of living only for aesthetics.  

If Wilde warns me of the peril of obsession, Ishiguro’s *The Remains of the Day* points to the opposite danger: the slow suffocation of the self through duty. Stevens, the butler, polishes silver until it gleams, sustains order as though his existence depends on it, and in so doing allows the years to slip away. His refusal to acknowledge his longings, his repression of grief, even his halting silence with Miss Kenton, leave him hollowed by the time he confronts what remains of his days. His tragedy is not excess but restraint: the iron grip of professionalism that strangles the warmth of human desire.  

Between Wilde and Ishiguro, I glimpse my own dilemma. On one side lies the risk of indulgence: of drowning in imagination until life itself becomes a theatre set. On the other lies the risk of devotion so complete that desire is extinguished. My job demands that I be a Stevens: dedicated, exacting, sober. My writing tempts me to be a Dorian: reckless in pursuit of beauty, careless of consequence. I move between them constantly: one moment the careful servant of order, the next the heedless devotee of imagination.  

With age I have come to see that life was never meant to be singular. It unfolds as a tapestry of contradictions, woven from duties and desires, pragmatism and passion. We cannot live on bread alone, nor can we live solely on dreams of love; both are needed, in their uneasy coexistence, to make a life whole. To admit that we are sustained as much by necessity as by longing is not a compromise but a kind of truth: the quiet recognition of what it means to live.  

And so, if Dorian teaches me the intoxication of beauty, and Stevens the barrenness of unyielding duty, then together they remind me that life is neither illusion nor servitude, but a fragile weaving of both. To live is not to flee one’s duties, nor to silence one’s desires, but to carry them in tension—and in that shimmering balance, to discover the self that belongs only to me.
