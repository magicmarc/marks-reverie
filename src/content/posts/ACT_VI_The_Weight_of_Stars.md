## Scene 1: The Stargazing  

*(The four friends sit by their tent, the coastal bush stretching into silence. A billion stars glitter above. They sprawl on sleeping bags, pointing out constellations.)*  

**AMBER** *(yawning, swatting a mosquito)*:  
Looks like three crooked buttons.  

**WAI** *(munching chips)*:  
I say that one’s a tennis racket. Definitely. Cosmic Wimbledon.  

**MARK** *(earnest, adjusting his glasses)*:  
Actually, that’s Scorpius. See—the curve?  

**AMBER:**  
You’d find homework in the heavens.  

*(They laugh. Slowly, sleep overtakes Amber, Wai, and Mark. They shuffle into the tent, leaving Will alone, gazing upward. His expression hardens, almost solemn. He reaches into his rucksack and pulls out a familiar object: a book. He flicks on a torch, tracing the cover with his thumb. The stars seem to pulse brighter.)*  

## Scene 2: The Radar Station  

*(In an instant, the wilderness dissolves. Will blinks—and finds himself before a massive radar station rising from the hillside, its dish sweeping across the night sky. He doesn’t flinch. Instead, he strides toward it, as if expected.)*  

*(Inside, consoles hum. Operators doze at their stations. Only one figure remains fully awake: **YE WENJIE**. Her eyes are hollow, her fingers tense over a command line. She stiffens as she notices Will, quickly reaching under the desk and drawing a small dagger.)*  

**YE WENJIE** *(coldly)*:  
Who are you?  

**WILL** *(raising his hands gently)*:  
Not an enemy. Just… someone who wants to know why.  

**YE WENJIE:**  
Why now? Why you? I’ve cried out to the universe a thousand times and no one answered.  

**WILL:**  
Because now is the moment. A pivot in human fate.  

**YE WENJIE** *(bitter laugh)*:  
Fate? Humanity is savage, short-sighted. We’ve burnt forests, poisoned rivers, turned science into war machines. We need change. We need allies beyond our petty wars. Out there—there must be something greater.  

**WILL** *(sharply)*:  
Or something worse. You’re gambling the future on strangers. What if they don’t come as saviours, but as predators?  

**YE WENJIE:**  
And what if they do come as saviours? Even predators would be better than the cancer we’ve become. At least then, the human story won’t rot in its own filth.  

**WILL:**  
You despise humanity, but you are still human. Doesn’t that disgust turn inward?  

**YE WENJIE** *(voice trembling, then rising)*:  
Yes! Every day. I watched my father beaten to death for books, my husband discarded like a pawn. I have seen kindness trampled, brilliance punished. You call this civilisation? It is a cage of cruelty. If salvation cannot be born here, then it must come from the stars.  

*(She points upward, eyes blazing.)*  

**YE WENJIE:**  
Humanity is a frog at the bottom of a well. The sky we see is a pitiful circle. We croak and quarrel, thinking our puddle is the world. But beyond the rim, the universe teems with oceans of light. Only by climbing out—by calling out—can we see truth.  

**WILL** *(meeting her gaze, voice low but cutting):*  
And yet even frogs learn to look up. Humanity’s gift is not power, but wonder. Children who trace constellations in the dirt, lovers who promise forever under the stars—we are the animal that lifts its eyes from the ground. That is enough to prove we’re not finished yet.  

**YE WENJIE** *(snapping back)*:  
Dreams don’t stop bullets. Wonder doesn’t clean poisoned rivers.  

**WILL:**  
No, but without wonder, we stop climbing. And if we surrender wonder to strangers, we may never rise at all.  

*(The two glare at each other. For a long moment, only the low hum of the radar fills the air. Ye Wenjie’s eyes soften briefly.)*  

**YE WENJIE:**  
The man who brought me here, who believed in me—he died in an accident. He said the stars would answer. I cannot let his faith be meaningless.  

**WILL** *(quietly, almost pleading):*  
So you’ll hand our destiny to strangers? To the unknown?  

**YE WENJIE** *(with steel, clutching the dagger tighter):*  
Better the unknown than the monster we already are.  

**WILL** *(sudden intensity):*  
No. Better the monster we know, the monster we can tame.  

*(The words strike like a whip. Her face twists—grief, rage, defiance. Before Will can say more, she lunges. The dagger plunges into his chest. His breath shudders, blood soaking his shirt. She whirls back to the console, typing frantically. The screen floods with cascading code, star maps flashing like wounds across the dark. Will collapses, clutching the wound, strength ebbing.)*  


## Scene 3: The Wound and the Stars  

*(Will lies collapsed on the cold concrete, blood seeping from his chest. His breath comes in ragged gasps. Ye Wenjie stands by the console, her code already streaming across the screen. Her dagger drips crimson. The signal has been sent. The decision is made.)*  

*(Suddenly, a ripple of light—Mark stumbles into the room, clutching the book to his chest. His eyes widen as he sees Will on the ground.)*  

**MARK** *(shouting, rushing to his side)*:  
Will! No—please, stay with me!  

*(He presses his hands against the wound, tears streaking his face. Will groans, trying to raise a hand to brush Mark’s cheek, but his strength fails.)*  

**MARK** *(sobbing)*:  
You can’t go. Not like this. You’re my friend—my impossible, infuriating friend.  

*(For the first time, Ye Wenjie’s expression softens. She sets the dagger down, her face lined with exhaustion.)*  

**YE WENJIE** *(quietly):*  
I have no quarrel with you. The choice is already made. Humanity’s message has been launched… but this man need not die for it.  

*(She kneels beside them, her movements surprisingly gentle. She gestures toward a side door. Together they half-carry, half-drag Will into a small medical room. The emergency lamp buzzes overhead as Ye Wenjie helps Mark find bandages, disinfectant. Her hands, once cruel, are steady as she ties the dressing.)*  

**MARK** *(looking at her through tears):*  
Why… why help us now?  

**YE WENJIE** *(softly, with a bitter smile):*  
And even monsters weep when children bleed.  

*(Will, pale but stable, slips into unconsciousness. Mark sits beside him, gripping his hand. Across the room, Ye Wenjie sinks into a chair, her eyes lost in thought. Mark wipes his face, then turns toward her.)*  

**MARK** *(quietly, voice breaking):*  
Thank you. I thought… I thought we’d lost him. Whatever else you’ve done—thank you.  

*(Ye Wenjie doesn’t answer, but her gaze softens, the dagger at her side forgotten. The silence between them is heavy but not hostile. Mark takes a shaky breath, words tumbling out before he can stop them.)*  

**MARK:**  
You know… I’ve spent so much of my life trying to live by the rules. My family’s rules, society’s rules, the script that says who I’m supposed to be. I thought if I kept everything neat and perfect, maybe the world would finally leave me alone. But it never does.  

*(He looks down at Will’s limp hand in his own, voice trembling.)*  

**MARK:**  
And then he crashes into my life, loud and impossible. And suddenly the script doesn’t fit anymore. Sometimes I think—maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re meant to stumble off the path.  

*(Ye Wenjie studies him, her face unreadable. Mark looks up, eyes red, but steady.)*  

**MARK:**  
Do you… do you believe in *the script*? Or in our power to change it?  

**YE WENJIE** *(after a long pause, her tone measured):*  
Physics has not answered that question. Entropy rules, but choice whispers. Perhaps both are true, perhaps neither.  

*(Ye Wenjie exhales, almost a sigh. They fall silent together. Outside the window, the stars blaze differently—patterns alien, constellations unrecognisable. Mark sits beside her, sharing the stillness. For a moment, there is no war, no betrayal, only the infinite night.)*  

**MARK** *(softly, almost to himself):*  
Even if the stars cage us… we still look up.  

*(He closes his eyes, lifts the book in his hand, and slowly shuts it. The radar station dissolves into starlight. When he opens his eyes again, he and Will are back at the campsite, the Southern sky arching above, familiar and infinite. Will stirs faintly beside him, alive. Mark lets out a shuddering breath, clutching the book 'The Three-Body Problem' to his chest.)*  


## Scene 4: Back to the Camp  

*(Amber and Wai rush over, their footsteps loud on the scrub. Mark steadies Will with a hand, grounding him. Will blinks up at them, pale but breathing. The horizon is empty where the radar station once loomed; only dark bush and the vast southern sky remain, burning with impossible clarity.)*  

**AMBER** *(kneeling, voice sharp but shaken):*  
Bloody hell, Will—are you hurt? Don’t you dare die on us, I’ve still got rent money to squeeze out of you.  

**WAI** *(hovering awkwardly, wringing his cap):*  
Yeah, mate, you look wrecked. Want me to carry you back? Or, uh… call triple zero?  

*(Will coughs, then waves them off with infuriating calm. A thin smile curves his lips.)*  

**WILL** *(dry, almost mocking):*  
Relax. If I were dying, I’d make it far more dramatic. This—this is just a scratch.  

*(Amber scowls, half-relieved, half-annoyed. Wai exhales, muttering under his breath. Mark squeezes Will’s shoulder, still tense. Will lets the silence hang for a beat, then his tone shifts—silken, edged with that familiar darkness.)*  

**WILL:**  
Tell me, then. Since you’re all hovering like mother hens—when you look up at that sky, what do you actually see?  

*(The others glance at one another. For once, no jokes come quickly. The stars wheel above, merciless and magnificent.)*  

**AMBER** *(quiet for once, then softly):*  
I see fire. Millions of lanterns, carried by hands we’ll never touch. It’s beautiful… and it doesn’t need us at all.  

**WAI** *(swallowing hard, voice unsteady):*  
I see distance. Courts so wide I’ll never reach the baseline. Makes every point I win here feel tiny. Terrifying, really.  

**MARK** *(his gaze fixed upward, trembling with awe):*  
I see questions without answers. Patterns too vast for us to solve. Wonder, and dread, all knotted together.  

*(They fall into silence. For a long moment, the only sound is the surf against the cliffs, steady and eternal. The stars blaze above, indifferent and magnificent.)*  

**WILL** *(finally, his voice low, weighted, almost tender beneath the bite):*  
I see how small we are. How fragile. And yet—how lucky, that we get to look up at all.  

*(The others nod. No laughter this time. They lie back together on the cool earth, shoulder to shoulder, four figures dwarfed by the infinite night. The bush hums, the sea breathes, and under the Southern sky they feel both terrified and tender, impossibly small and quietly infinite.)*
