# Returning to Eastford

Before moving to Australia, I lived in **Eastford**. 

The city shaped me in countless ways — its relentless rhythm and its curious balance of warmth and reserve. Time and distance softened my memories, yet Eastford remained imprinted on me like an old watermark.

Years later, I returned — not alone, but with two Australian friends: **Vincent**, of European background, and **Minh**, whose family roots are in Vietnam. For me it was a homecoming; for them it was an adventure into the unknown.

As the plane lifted from Eastford towards Sydney at the end of our journey, I felt compelled to set down what had passed. For whilst I had revisited familiar streets, I also discovered them anew, reflected through their foreign eyes.

At first they were enchanted — dazzled by the food, the glittering harbour lights, the ceaseless vitality of the streets. But by the third day, Minh admitted that something about the city unsettled him. Soon after, Vincent quipped, half in jest, “I think I’ve lost my superpowers here.”

Intrigued, I pressed them for details.

## Lost in the Maze

Both explained that in Australia, their sense of direction was impeccable. Having grown up driving, they rarely needed a map. But in Eastford, where life is tethered to the sprawling underground railway, they were constantly disoriented. I, who knew the stations and exits by heart, could navigate with ease. For me, spotting the nearest station was enough to regain my bearings.

But for them, deprived of street-level landmarks and the sun’s rising and setting as their compass, this subterranean shuttling through shopping malls and escalators was maddening.

I reassured them: “Here you don’t need direction. Just follow the signs.” Minh looked genuinely shocked.

“How can life be lived without direction?” he asked, half-serious. We laughed, though the unease lingered.

## Connections

Vincent was troubled by something else. He remarked that the women of Eastford were strikingly beautiful, impeccably dressed, yet not once had one smiled at him.

I rolled my eyes. “Really, Vincent? You’re being absurdly self-assured. Why on earth should they smile at you simply because you’re foreign? You’re not special here — Eastford has seen plenty of Western faces.”

I was ready to give him a lecture, but Minh surprised me by agreeing. “Yes. I’ve noticed the same. People are polite, service is efficient, but no one looks at me as if I matter. It’s as though I’m invisible.”

That struck me. In Australia, even when you buy a coffee, the barista will exchange a few warm words. In Eastford, the cup is handed over promptly, efficiently — and that is that.

Vincent then nodded towards a young woman nearby. “Look at her — she’s stunning, yet her eyes are empty.”

I glanced. She was simply dressed as an office worker.

“That’s just professional attire,” I explained. “Here, looking polished is part of the job. Men wear suits and ties, women wear dresses, heels, a touch of make-up. It’s not about self-expression, it’s about professionalism. In fact, our HR departments issue very specific dress codes: what fabrics are acceptable, what colour lipstick, even the height of heels.”

I paused, remembering. “I once wore a shirt that had faded slightly from too many washes — and my boss scolded me for looking careless. And I still recall my first interview in Australia: I arrived in a full suit and tie, only to find the interviewer in a short-sleeved shirt. The whole hospital office was dressed casually, and I was the only one in a suit. You can imagine my embarrassment.”

They both stared in disbelief.

“So she dresses like that… for work?”

“Of course,” I said. “Who would want to conduct business with someone scruffy?”

“That,” Minh murmured, “is even more unsettling.”

Vincent threw up his hands. “This must be a nightmare! I need to wake up.”

## The Expat Bubble

Later I brought them into my English-speaking circle at a European-style bar. Wine glasses clinked, conversations flowed in a dozen accents. Surely, I thought, this would give them the warmth they craved.

I introduced them to Edward, a long-settled Englishman, and Julien from France. They spoke animatedly about their lives, but when asked whether they had local friends, Edward shrugged — “Not really. We just have different ways.” Julien explained he was often between Europe and Eastford, with little time for deeper ties.

On our way back to the hotel, Vincent burst out: “They know nothing of the locals! They live entirely inside an English-speaking bubble.”

“Eastfordian is terribly hard,” I replied. “Even Newbridgian would be easier.”

But Minh was thoughtful. “It’s not just the language. It’s the lack of desire to connect. The body speaks when words fail, but here, even when people understand English, they don’t seem to want the exchange.”

I countered, a little defensive: “Local people don’t owe you their time. They work hard all day, then go home to families to feed. They’re not like Australians who can linger over coffee or wine after work. They’ve no energy left for idle chatter.”  

But Minh pressed on: “Even amongst themselves, I sense little exchange. Yes, there are couples and families, but even they seem to walk side by side without speaking.”  

I shook my head and pointed across the street at a young couple laughing together. “See? They do talk.”  

Minh persisted. “Perhaps. But from what I’ve seen, people are taught from childhood not to speak to strangers, not to meddle. ‘Keep to yourself, don’t draw trouble,’ isn’t that the lesson here?”  

I sighed. “Yes. That’s how our parents raised us.”  

Vincent interjected, with his characteristic exaggeration: “It’s driving me mad. Get us out of here, Mark. Anywhere else. Please.”

## Escaping Mainland

Eventually, Minh pleaded, “Mark, take us anywhere, even across to the mainland. I need to breathe.” Vincent nodded: “Yes, I want to see the sun again.”

So we boarded the new high-speed rail to Newbridge. I thought of a film once popular, *Crossing Mainland*, in which the heroine escaped the suffocation of the mainland by slipping into Eastford and gasping the air of freedom. Yet here we were, three travellers, fleeing in the opposite direction — and finding air that felt, in its way, freer.

Once there, we were struck by the contrast. The streets teemed with groups — colleagues sneaking out for milk tea, friends laughing and jostling, not just couples or families but whole clusters of people enjoying each other’s company.

“Good heavens, she smiled at me!” Vincent exclaimed. A modest, slightly plump young woman had glanced our way and, catching his gaze, blushed and smiled before walking on. He was radiant.

Over lunch, the waiter enthusiastically described each dish — even though he must have known we barely understood a word. Still, he wanted us to feel part of the meal, pointing out ingredients, gesturing with delight.  

“Do you feel it, Mark?” Minh said excitedly. “Even without language, he wanted to share something with us — not merely perform a duty.”

When we left, the young waiter waved vigorously, sensing we did not understand his words but eager to leave us with warmth. Minh waved back with equal force.  

Indeed, willingness to connect mattered more than the tools of communication.  

“We are so happy,” they both said with wonder, as though the air itself had changed.

## An Honest Driver

Back in Eastford, on our way to the great Buddha, we took a taxi. I sat up front with Mr. Chan, who chatted in Eastfordian about his family, his children’s schooling, and the hardships of city life.

When he asked if my friends had enjoyed the city, I admitted, “They find it a little cold compared with Australia.”

“You’re not wrong,” he replied. “Here, people lack trust. In the villages, neighbours knew one another. In the city, everyone guards against everyone else. That’s the way to survive. What we’re best at here is oppressing one another.”

My friends listened from the back seat, delighted to hear such a torrent of heartfelt words, even if they couldn’t understand them.

"Good job, Mark." 

Minh was thrilled to witness, for the first time, an Eastfordian conversation alive with passion.

## The Final Encounter

On our last day, at the airport, Clara at the check-in desk treated my friends with cold professionalism, yet when she turned to my Eastford passport, her tone sharpened. She demanded proof of my visa with such severity that I fumbled like a schoolboy caught unprepared, digging frantically through my phone until I produced the PDF.

At last the papers were in order. My friends prepared to leave the desk when Clara leaned in, eyes fierce beneath her immaculate make-up, and said in Eastfordian: “Be clever out there, Eastford boy.” Her eyes bulged with an intensity that could be read as warning, encouragement, or threat.  

My friends, sensing the friction though not the words, asked if I was in trouble. I forced a smile. “This is simply how we Eastfordian speak to one another.” They shuddered visibly at the thought.

## Epilogue

Tomorrow my friends would awaken from this dream and step lightly back into their lives. I, however, must go on with it — hoping that, in time, it will thin to vapour and drift away as a *cloud* of its own.
