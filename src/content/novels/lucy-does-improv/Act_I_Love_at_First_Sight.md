Lucy was an accounting student. In class she always sat near the front, her notebook neatly lined, her hand shooting up whenever the lecturer posed a question. Her answers were precise, her tone composed, as if she had rehearsed them the night before. When group discussions began, she leaned in with practiced interest, nodding, underlining, filling margins with tidy annotations.

Her classmates admired her diligence, yet kept a certain distance. There was something in her manner—too intent, too tightly wound—that felt more like obligation than ease. A seriousness that seemed out of place in a sea of casual chatter and half-formed jokes.

Lucy, for her part, found them equally puzzling. Their laughter struck her as shallow, their drifting attention a kind of weakness. She smiled when courtesy demanded, but behind it she wondered why no one else seemed to carry the weight she carried.

Still, she persisted. Equation by equation, ratio by ratio, she pressed herself into the shape of a perfect student. Until, one afternoon, the numbers blurred, and through the open door of the hall came a sound that jarred her concentration—laughter. Loud, unrestrained, entirely at odds with the quiet discipline of the lecture.

When class ended, her steps should have taken her to the library. Instead, as though nudged by some invisible current, they drifted—hesitant, reluctant, yet curious—toward the room at the end of the hall, where that laughter lived: **The Improv Club**.

## First Encounter

Inside, *Joseph*, the president of the improv club, greeted her with open warmth. And there was *Bella*, a first-year computer science student who had only recently joined. Bella’s smile carried the ease of someone unafraid of being seen. Lucy clutched her books tighter to her chest, her knuckles pale, as if they were her last shield.

She hadn’t planned this. Her mind was still buzzing with tonight’s assignments—formulas to memorise, chapters to review. Yet her feet had brought her here, and now she stood at the threshold, caught between guilt and curiosity.

The room was alive. A few students were in the middle of a scene, voices loud, arms flung wide in absurd gestures. Others laughed from the sidelines, calling out prompts, encouraging with playful shouts. The air was warm, humid with energy, their faces open, their bodies unafraid to look ridiculous. Compared to the stiff rows of her lecture hall, the difference was dizzying.

Joseph stepped forward, his grin disarming, his voice a booming invitation that seemed to sweep her into the circle before she had a chance to retreat. Bella mirrored the welcome, her expression unguarded, her presence calm but confident. They felt—different. Less like students burdened with grades and futures, more like people who had found a space where they could simply exist.

For a brief, impossible moment, Lucy felt it: the thought that perhaps this was where she belonged, that this chaotic, reckless laughter was the world she had been missing all along. The thought bloomed—and then, frightened by its own daring, she crushed it quickly, burying it under the weight of duty.

But by then, it was too late. Somehow she was inside the circle, Joseph already in character as the booming landlord, Bella slipping easily into the role of a nosy neighbour, and Lucy herself—awkward, trembling—cast as the poor tenant who could not pay her rent.

Joseph (landlord, chest puffed out): “Rent! Where is my rent? This is the third month! Do you think I run a charity?”

Lucy (tenant, startled): “I—I—I… I’ll pay next week, I promise—”

Bella (as the nosy neighbour, leaning in conspiratorially): “Oh, Mr. Landlord, I saw her buying cookies yesterday. Fancy cookies. Clearly she has money. She just doesn’t respect you.”

(Joseph gasps in mock outrage, pointing at Lucy like a judge about to deliver a sentence.)

Joseph: “Cookies! You dare eat cookies when you owe me rent?”

Lucy (blurting out): “They—they were on sale!”

Bella (smirking, circling Lucy like a detective): “On sale? Lies! I checked the supermarket flyers. They weren’t discounted at all.”

(Gasps from Joseph. Lucy looks cornered, her face flushing as she tries to think of an excuse. Then, without warning, Bella breaks character—her body twists, and she launches into an exaggerated dance: wild hip sways, arms flailing, spinning like a puppet on broken strings.)

Joseph (quick to adapt, clapping to her rhythm): “Oh no! The neighbour’s curse has begun again. Every time she smells unpaid rent, she dances!”

(The room bursts into laughter. Bella twirls closer to Lucy, who freezes, eyes wide. Joseph claps louder, chanting like a priest banishing spirits.)

Joseph: “Tenant, only you can stop her! Confess! Admit your guilt!”

Lucy (stammering, voice cracking): “I—I admit nothing! I… I only wanted cookies—”

(Bella suddenly spins to a stop, staring directly into Lucy’s eyes with mock ferocity. Lucy bursts into a nervous giggle, forgetting her lines entirely. For a beat, she just stands there, caught in the current of their energy, half-terrified, half-alive.)

The scene collapsed into laughter, but for Lucy, the air was still trembling, as though something inside her had cracked open.

Lucy froze. Her throat locked. She wanted to laugh but feared the sound of it. She wanted to speak but found herself mute. Something broke loose in her chest, and for a moment she looked almost alive.  

That night at home, Lucy sat hunched over her books, her forehead pressed hard against the page. She copied the same formula three times, then ripped it out and began again. A voice she would not name seemed to hover in the silence: disapproving, heavy, impossible to please. She whispered into the paper, almost a prayer:  

*“Tomorrow, I will be good and focus on my accounting class. I will.”*  


## The Family Game

But the next day, when the final bell rang, her feet betrayed her. Again she found herself outside the club room.  

Bella wore silver earrings this time, her hair tied back neatly, the shine catching every flicker of the light. Joseph’s calm presence steadied the room, as though he were the quiet anchor in a sea of make-believe. Lucy found herself staring at them too long, her gaze clinging as if to fix their shapes in memory—Bella’s assured posture, Joseph’s unhurried voice.

That evening, the game was simple: play a family. Joseph slipped easily into the role of a father, puffing his chest and lowering his voice with exaggerated seriousness. Bella, without hesitation, became the mother—her tone sharp one moment, tender the next, a theatrical rhythm that made the room ripple with amusement. And Lucy—Lucy was the daughter.

At first, she played it clumsily. Her voice cracked when she called Joseph “Dad,” her lips stumbled over “Mom” when she looked at Bella. But then, as Bella drew her close and let Lucy’s head rest against her shoulder, something shifted. The warmth of skin, the steadiness of breath—it felt absurd, almost embarrassing, yet unbearably comforting. A warmth she had never known how to ask for.

For a fleeting instant, she let go. She allowed herself to sink into it, into the fragile illusion of belonging. It was a child’s game, yet her chest ached as though it touched something raw.

And then—the scene ended. Joseph clapped his hands, breaking character with a grin. Bella laughed and stretched her arms. Lucy jerked back to herself, her spine stiffening, her hands clutching at her books as if they were evidence of some theft.

The laughter still echoed around her, but inside, Lucy felt the cold snap of guilt, as though she had trespassed into a happiness she was never meant to have. 

That night, a message from Joseph lit her phone. The vibration rattled the desk. Lucy stared at it, eyes wide, before flinging the phone across the room with a choked sound. She pressed herself against her books, panting, as if covering a crime.  

Weeks passed. She buried herself in assignments, copying whole chapters at once, eyes red from lack of sleep. Her demon always died... almost. 


##  The Gaze in the Square

Until one afternoon, crossing the campus square, Lucy stumbled into a crowd. A temporary stage had been raised, students milling about, laughter echoing. Onstage, Joseph and Bella were mid-performance, their voices rolling out like a spell that caught even passersby.

Joseph suddenly straightened, throwing his arm wide with theatrical command:
“Bella!”

His voice cracked like a whip, then softened into a grin. His gaze swept the audience deliberately, a game she recognised now—the familiar trick of improv: draw someone in, pull the crowd closer by singling out the most withdrawn, the shyest, the one who least wanted the spotlight.

Bella followed the cue. Her eyes scanned the crowd, hawk-like, sharp and merciless in their hunt. Students tittered nervously, ducking behind each other. Then—her gaze landed on Lucy.

For a moment, time fractured.

Lucy’s body jolted as though caught stealing. Heat surged into her face. Her hands shook, clutching her bag, but her eyes—traitorous, trembling—stayed locked with Bella’s. In those three unbearable seconds, everything collapsed into contradiction: the shame of being exposed, the terror of being seen, the guilt of returning again and again to what she swore to resist. Yet beneath all of it, another current swelled—an aching recognition, a secret hunger to be chosen, to be pulled into the circle rather than left at the edges.

Her breath caught. Bella’s eyes were not cruel, not mocking, just steady, direct, as though asking something Lucy had no words for.

Then, mercifully, Bella looked away. The crowd exhaled.

Lucy didn’t. She broke into a run, heart hammering, her legs carrying her out of the square before the applause could follow. She fled to her dorm, slammed the door, and pressed her phone to her chest as though it might scorch her.

Tears came hot and fast. Her chest convulsed with each breath, as if something poisonous had already entered her blood. She pressed her palm against her mouth to stifle the sound, but the tremor would not stop.

Between gasps she whispered:
**“Why won’t you let me go?”**

Her phone lay on the desk, screen glowing faintly. She reached for it as though it burned, pulled back, then reached again. A sick dread tightened her stomach—the same terror as touching a substance she knew would ruin her, yet could not resist.

At last, trembling, she opened Joseph’s old message. Her fingers hovered, then moved with dreadful slowness, each keystroke a betrayal, each letter a surrender.

She typed, haltingly, as though carving words she had no right to speak:

**“See you tomorrow.”**
