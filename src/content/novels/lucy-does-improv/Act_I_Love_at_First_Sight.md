Lucy was an accounting student. She sat in class, her pen scratching furiously across the margins of her notebook—equations, fragments of words, then long, useless lines drawn again and again until the page tore. Sometimes she smiled faintly at nothing, then seconds later her face collapsed into panic as though she had made a terrible mistake no one else could see.  

Her classmates gave her space. To them, she seemed strange: restless, distracted, prone to sudden stillness as though listening to voices no one else could hear.  

On afternoons like this, even the balance sheet blurred. Numbers tumbled into each other, ratios turned to static. Lucy pressed her palm to the paper as if pinning it down, but her mind wandered. Somewhere down the hallway, laughter spilled out—sharp, unrestrained, a sound that didn’t belong to the quiet tyranny of the lecture hall.  

Her steps, when class ended, did not take her back to the library as they should have. Instead they carried her, hesitant, guilty, almost sleepwalking, to the room where that laughter lived - **the Improv Club**.

Inside, **Joseph**, the president of the improv club, greeted her with open warmth. And there's **Bella**, a first-year computer science student who just joined the club. Bella’s smile had the ease of someone unafraid of being seen. Lucy clutched her books tight against her chest, her knuckles pale.  

Lucy hardly realised how it happened. One moment she was hugging her books, the next she was inside the circle, Joseph already booming with authority.

Joseph (landlord, chest puffed out): “Rent! Where is my rent? This is the third month! Do you think I run a charity?”

Lucy (tenant, startled): “I—I—I… I’ll pay next week, I promise—”

Bella (as the nosy neighbour, leaning in conspiratorially): “Oh, Mr. Landlord, I saw her buying cookies yesterday. Fancy cookies. Clearly she has money. She just doesn’t respect you.”

(Joseph gasps in mock outrage, pointing at Lucy like a judge about to deliver a sentence.)

Joseph: “Cookies! You dare eat cookies when you owe me rent?”

Lucy (blurting out): “They—they were on sale!”

Bella (smirking, circling Lucy like a detective): “On sale? Lies! I checked the supermarket flyers. They weren’t discounted at all.”

(Gasps from Joseph. Lucy looks cornered, her face flushing as she tries to think of an excuse. Then, without warning, Bella breaks character—her body twists, and she launches into an exaggerated dance: wild hip sways, arms flailing, spinning like a puppet on broken strings.)

Joseph (quick to adapt, clapping to her rhythm): “Oh no! The neighbour’s curse has begun again. Every time she smells unpaid rent, she dances!”

(The room bursts into laughter. Bella twirls closer to Lucy, who freezes, eyes wide. Joseph claps louder, chanting like a priest banishing spirits.)

Joseph: “Tenant, only you can stop her! Confess! Admit your guilt!”

Lucy (stammering, voice cracking): “I—I admit nothing! I… I only wanted cookies—”

(Bella suddenly spins to a stop, staring directly into Lucy’s eyes with mock ferocity. Lucy bursts into a nervous giggle, forgetting her lines entirely. For a beat, she just stands there, caught in the current of their energy, half-terrified, half-alive.)

The scene collapsed into laughter, but for Lucy, the air was still trembling, as though something inside her had cracked open.

Lucy froze. Her throat locked. She wanted to laugh but feared the sound of it. She wanted to speak but found herself mute. Something broke loose in her chest, and for a moment she looked almost alive.  

That night at home, Lucy sat hunched over her books, her forehead pressed hard against the page. She copied the same formula three times, then ripped it out and began again. A voice she would not name seemed to hover in the silence: disapproving, heavy, impossible to please. She whispered into the paper, almost a prayer:  

*“Tomorrow, I will be good and focus on my accounting class. I will.”*  

But the next day, when the final bell rang, her feet betrayed her. Again she found herself outside the club room.  

Bella wore silver earrings this time, her hair tied back. Joseph’s presence steadied the room. Lucy stared too long, as though memorising their outlines. That evening the three played a family: Joseph and Bella the parents, Lucy the daughter. She leaned into Bella’s shoulder and felt a warmth she had never known how to ask for.  

For an instant, she looked at peace. Then the scene ended, and her arms snapped back to her books as though she had been caught stealing.  

That night, a message from Joseph lit her phone. The vibration rattled the desk. Lucy stared at it, eyes wide, before flinging the phone across the room with a choked sound. She pressed herself against her books, panting, as if covering a crime.  

Weeks passed. She buried herself in assignments, copying whole chapters at once, eyes red from lack of sleep. She thought the hunger would die.  

Until one afternoon, crossing the campus square, she stumbled into a crowd. A small stage had been raised. Joseph and Bella were performing, voices carrying like a spell.  

Joseph shouted, “Bella!” His gaze swept the audience. Bella’s eyes followed, hawk-like, catching Lucy where she stood.  

Time froze. Lucy’s hands shook, but her eyes locked with Bella’s. Three seconds, endless, unbearable. Then Bella looked away.  

Lucy ran. She fled to her dorm, clutching her phone as though it burned. Tears streaked down her cheeks as she whispered:  

*“Why won’t you let me go?”*  

At last, trembling, she opened Joseph’s old message. She typed slowly, as though the words themselves were forbidden:  

**“See you tomorrow.”**
