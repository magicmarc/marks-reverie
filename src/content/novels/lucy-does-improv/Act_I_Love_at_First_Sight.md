Lucy was an accounting student. She sat in class, her pen scratching furiously across the margins of her notebook—equations, fragments of words, then long, useless lines drawn again and again until the page tore. Sometimes she smiled faintly at nothing, then seconds later her face collapsed into panic as though she had made a terrible mistake no one else could see.  

Her classmates gave her space. To them, she seemed strange: restless, distracted, prone to sudden stillness as though listening to voices no one else could hear.  

On afternoons like this, even the balance sheet blurred. Numbers tumbled into each other, ratios turned to static. Lucy pressed her palm to the paper as if pinning it down, but her mind wandered. Somewhere down the hallway, laughter spilled out—sharp, unrestrained, a sound that didn’t belong to the quiet tyranny of the lecture hall.  

Her steps, when class ended, did not take her back to the library as they should have. Instead they carried her, hesitant, guilty, almost sleepwalking, to the room where that laughter lived - **The Improv Club**.


## First Encounter

Inside, **Joseph**, the president of the improv club, greeted her with open warmth. And there's **Bella**, a first-year computer science student who just joined the club. Bella’s smile had the ease of someone unafraid of being seen. Lucy clutched her books tight against her chest, her knuckles pale.  

Lucy hardly realised how it happened. One moment she was hugging her books, the next she was inside the circle, Joseph already booming with authority.

Joseph (landlord, chest puffed out): “Rent! Where is my rent? This is the third month! Do you think I run a charity?”

Lucy (tenant, startled): “I—I—I… I’ll pay next week, I promise—”

Bella (as the nosy neighbour, leaning in conspiratorially): “Oh, Mr. Landlord, I saw her buying cookies yesterday. Fancy cookies. Clearly she has money. She just doesn’t respect you.”

(Joseph gasps in mock outrage, pointing at Lucy like a judge about to deliver a sentence.)

Joseph: “Cookies! You dare eat cookies when you owe me rent?”

Lucy (blurting out): “They—they were on sale!”

Bella (smirking, circling Lucy like a detective): “On sale? Lies! I checked the supermarket flyers. They weren’t discounted at all.”

(Gasps from Joseph. Lucy looks cornered, her face flushing as she tries to think of an excuse. Then, without warning, Bella breaks character—her body twists, and she launches into an exaggerated dance: wild hip sways, arms flailing, spinning like a puppet on broken strings.)

Joseph (quick to adapt, clapping to her rhythm): “Oh no! The neighbour’s curse has begun again. Every time she smells unpaid rent, she dances!”

(The room bursts into laughter. Bella twirls closer to Lucy, who freezes, eyes wide. Joseph claps louder, chanting like a priest banishing spirits.)

Joseph: “Tenant, only you can stop her! Confess! Admit your guilt!”

Lucy (stammering, voice cracking): “I—I admit nothing! I… I only wanted cookies—”

(Bella suddenly spins to a stop, staring directly into Lucy’s eyes with mock ferocity. Lucy bursts into a nervous giggle, forgetting her lines entirely. For a beat, she just stands there, caught in the current of their energy, half-terrified, half-alive.)

The scene collapsed into laughter, but for Lucy, the air was still trembling, as though something inside her had cracked open.

Lucy froze. Her throat locked. She wanted to laugh but feared the sound of it. She wanted to speak but found herself mute. Something broke loose in her chest, and for a moment she looked almost alive.  

That night at home, Lucy sat hunched over her books, her forehead pressed hard against the page. She copied the same formula three times, then ripped it out and began again. A voice she would not name seemed to hover in the silence: disapproving, heavy, impossible to please. She whispered into the paper, almost a prayer:  

*“Tomorrow, I will be good and focus on my accounting class. I will.”*  


## The Family Game

But the next day, when the final bell rang, her feet betrayed her. Again she found herself outside the club room.  

Bella wore silver earrings this time, her hair tied back neatly, the shine catching every flicker of the light. Joseph’s calm presence steadied the room, as though he were the quiet anchor in a sea of make-believe. Lucy found herself staring at them too long, her gaze clinging as if to fix their shapes in memory—Bella’s assured posture, Joseph’s unhurried voice.

That evening, the game was simple: play a family. Joseph slipped easily into the role of a father, puffing his chest and lowering his voice with exaggerated seriousness. Bella, without hesitation, became the mother—her tone sharp one moment, tender the next, a theatrical rhythm that made the room ripple with amusement. And Lucy—Lucy was the daughter.

At first, she played it clumsily. Her voice cracked when she called Joseph “Dad,” her lips stumbled over “Mom” when she looked at Bella. But then, as Bella drew her close and let Lucy’s head rest against her shoulder, something shifted. The warmth of skin, the steadiness of breath—it felt absurd, almost embarrassing, yet unbearably comforting. A warmth she had never known how to ask for.

For a fleeting instant, she let go. She allowed herself to sink into it, into the fragile illusion of belonging. It was a child’s game, yet her chest ached as though it touched something raw.

And then—the scene ended. Joseph clapped his hands, breaking character with a grin. Bella laughed and stretched her arms. Lucy jerked back to herself, her spine stiffening, her hands clutching at her books as if they were evidence of some theft.

The laughter still echoed around her, but inside, Lucy felt the cold snap of guilt, as though she had trespassed into a happiness she was never meant to have. 

That night, a message from Joseph lit her phone. The vibration rattled the desk. Lucy stared at it, eyes wide, before flinging the phone across the room with a choked sound. She pressed herself against her books, panting, as if covering a crime.  

Weeks passed. She buried herself in assignments, copying whole chapters at once, eyes red from lack of sleep. She thought the hunger would die.  


##  The Gaze in the Square

Until one afternoon, crossing the campus square, Lucy stumbled into a crowd. A temporary stage had been raised, students milling about, laughter echoing. Onstage, Joseph and Bella were mid-performance, their voices rolling out like a spell that caught even passersby.

Joseph suddenly straightened, throwing his arm wide with theatrical command:
“Bella!”

His voice cracked like a whip, then softened into a grin. His gaze swept the audience deliberately, a game she recognised now—the familiar trick of improv: draw someone in, pull the crowd closer by singling out the most withdrawn, the shyest, the one who least wanted the spotlight.

Bella followed the cue. Her eyes scanned the crowd, hawk-like, sharp and merciless in their hunt. Students tittered nervously, ducking behind each other. Then—her gaze landed on Lucy.

For a moment, time fractured.

Lucy’s body jolted as though caught stealing. Heat surged into her face. Her hands shook, clutching her bag, but her eyes—traitorous, trembling—stayed locked with Bella’s. In those three unbearable seconds, everything collapsed into contradiction: the shame of being exposed, the terror of being seen, the guilt of returning again and again to what she swore to resist. Yet beneath all of it, another current swelled—an aching recognition, a secret hunger to be chosen, to be pulled into the circle rather than left at the edges.

Her breath caught. Bella’s eyes were not cruel, not mocking, just steady, direct, as though asking something Lucy had no words for.

Then, mercifully, Bella looked away. The crowd exhaled.

Lucy didn’t. She broke into a run, heart hammering, her legs carrying her out of the square before the applause could follow. She fled to her dorm, slammed the door, and pressed her phone to her chest as though it might scorch her.

Tears came hot and fast. Between gasps she whispered, raw and breaking:

**“Why won’t you let me go?”**

At last, trembling, she opened Joseph’s old message. She typed slowly, as though the words themselves were forbidden:  

**“See you tomorrow.”**
