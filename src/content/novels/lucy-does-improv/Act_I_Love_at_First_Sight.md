Lucy was an accounting student. On an ordinary afternoon, she sat in class, eyes glazed over as she read through yet another dull financial report. The numbers blurred into one another—assets, liabilities, balance sheets, ratios. Suddenly, her mind wandered. She remembered the improv club she had once glimpsed in the hallway, their laughter echoing far more brightly than any lecture on depreciation.  

When class ended, Lucy drifted—almost without meaning to—toward the gathering place of that very improv club.  

The club’s president, Joseph, greeted her warmly. Another member, a girl named Bella, smiled and waved. That day, Lucy joined her very first improv exercise. Joseph played the role of a grumpy landlord; Bella, the fierce landlady; and Lucy, the hapless tenant who couldn’t pay her rent. They began their scene. Joseph barked, Bella scolded, Lucy stammered. Suddenly, Bella burst into an impromptu dance, twirling and stamping across the room. Lucy, caught between shock and awe, forgot her lines entirely. But something inside her cracked open—something playful, wild, and alive.  

Afterward, Lucy found herself drawn deeper and deeper into the practice. She looked again at her accounting balance sheets and found them unbearably boring. Joseph and Bella were so much more interesting than her classmates. Soon, she was waiting eagerly for every class to end, just so she could meet them.  

One day Joseph said to her: “If you want to improve, our club alone won’t be enough. You’ll need proper training.”  

Lucy searched online and found a workshop run by a woman named Catherine. At her first class, Catherine asked her to make a movement. Awkward and stiff, Lucy crouched into a clumsy horse stance. But Catherine gently held Lucy’s shoulders and lifted her leg with an elegant sweep. In that instant, Lucy’s body felt as if it extended infinitely outward, reaching further than she ever thought possible.  

It was the first time Lucy felt something so moving, so powerful—like destiny itself was calling her to do improv, not accounting. The calling was overwhelming, almost terrifying. She wanted to throw everything else away.  

But then she remembered her mother’s words—her mother who had always scolded her for being selfish, for never thinking of others, for being the “little girl who acts on whims.” Her mother worked tirelessly, paying Lucy’s tuition so she could study accounting. How could Lucy waste that?  

Panicked, Lucy grabbed her accounting assignments and tried to make up for the lecture she had missed. She read furiously, flipping through the entire textbook, tears welling up in her eyes. She locked herself in the study room, desperate, anxious, determined to drown out the voice that called her elsewhere. For a moment, improv disappeared from her mind.  

But the very next day, after class, Lucy once again found herself—almost unknowingly—walking toward the improv club.  

This time, Bella was dressed differently. She wore silver earrings and had tied her hair up. To Lucy, she looked suddenly beautiful—almost sensual. She glanced at Joseph, who was also striking in his own way. Lucy felt lucky, so lucky, to spend her evenings with them.  

That day, the three of them acted out a scene as a family. Joseph and Bella played the parents, and Lucy the daughter. She leaned against Bella, burying herself in her warmth. By accident, Lucy touched Bella’s chest—she blushed, embarrassed, but also comforted. Bella didn’t mind. They were lost in the game, in the strange intimacy improv allowed.  

When the activity ended, Lucy remembered her assignments and dashed back to her dorm. Clenching her teeth, she whispered: “Tomorrow, I must study. I must.”  

The next day, she kept her promise. She skipped the club. But Joseph sent her a message. When Lucy saw it, she froze. Her phone vibrated in her hand like a ghostly presence. Terrified, she threw it across the room, let out a small scream, and buried herself in accounting again. The messages stopped.  

Months passed. Lucy thought she was safe, that improv had been pushed aside. Until one afternoon, walking across campus, she stumbled into a crowd. A small stage had been set up in the square. And there they were—Joseph and Bella—performing improv for an audience.  

Joseph called out: “Bella!” His eyes scanned the crowd, looking for someone, anyone, uncertain, vulnerable.  

Bella’s eyes swept like a hawk across the square—sharp, piercing, predatory. Then suddenly, she locked eyes with Lucy.  

Time stopped. Lucy stared back, her body trembling but her gaze frozen in place. The world went silent. For three long seconds, they held each other in that terrifying, electric stare. Then, at last, Bella’s eyes moved on, to another unsuspecting spectator.  

Released, Lucy broke into a panicked run. She fled to her dorm, collapsed onto her bed, and clutched her phone with trembling hands. Tears in her voice, she whispered: “Why won’t you let me go?”  

At last, she opened Joseph’s old message—the one she had ignored for months. She typed, slowly, her fingers shaking:  

**“See you tomorrow.”**
