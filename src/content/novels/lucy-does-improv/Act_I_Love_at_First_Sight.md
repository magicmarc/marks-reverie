Lucy was an accounting student. On an ordinary afternoon, she sat in class, eyes glazed over as she read through yet another dull financial report. The numbers blurred into one another—assets, liabilities, balance sheets, ratios. To her classmates she seemed strange: restless, distracted, a faint smile flickering at the wrong times, as though her mind were elsewhere entirely.  

It was.  

Lucy remembered the improv club she had once glimpsed in the hallway, their laughter spilling out like sunlight. That joy stood in painful contrast to the world she carried from home.  

Her father had once loved performing, chasing small theater stages with a boyish hope that someday he would succeed. He never did. Now he worked in a repair shop, hands blackened with grease, his dreams reduced to silence. Her mother never forgave him for it. She became the backbone of the family—hard-working, tireless at the hospital—but also sharp, controlling, relentless.  

From Lucy’s earliest memory, her mother’s voice had been iron:  
*“If you waste time with friends, with clubs, with foolish hobbies, you’ll end up like your father—pathetic, broke, a burden. You owe me better.”*  

Those words echoed whenever Lucy dared to look at something outside her textbooks. They haunted her in the quiet hours of the library, binding her with guilt. Yet inside, the more her mother forbade, the more Lucy’s hunger grew—for friendship, for play, for another kind of life. That hunger leaked out in the odd way she carried herself at school: a mixture of tension, longing, and secrecy.  

When class ended, Lucy drifted—almost against her will—toward the gathering place of the improv club.  

The club’s president, Joseph, greeted her warmly. Another member, a girl named Bella, smiled with easy confidence. That day, Lucy joined her very first improv exercise. Joseph played the grumpy landlord; Bella, the sharp-tongued landlady; and Lucy, the hapless tenant unable to pay her rent. Joseph barked, Bella scolded, Lucy stammered. Then suddenly, Bella burst into a wild dance, twirling with arms flung wide.  

Lucy froze, caught between awe and terror. For a moment, she forgot her role entirely. Yet something cracked open inside her—a forbidden joy, raw and dangerous.  

Afterward, she looked again at her accounting notes and felt only disgust. The neat lines of the balance sheet seemed pale, lifeless. Joseph and Bella’s energy lingered in her chest like fire.  

But the fire was not free. She knew her mother would never forgive it. And she knew what her mother would say if she ever found out: *“You are throwing away your future. You are betraying me.”*  

Lucy pressed her forehead to her books that night, tears sliding silently onto the pages. She told herself she would study harder, crush the longing, bury the laughter that still rang in her ears.  

Yet the next day, when the final bell rang, her feet betrayed her. She found herself walking, almost sleepwalking, back toward the club.  

This time Bella wore silver earrings, her hair tied back. To Lucy, she looked almost dazzling, magnetic. Joseph, too, seemed brighter, his presence steadier than the classmates she never dared to befriend.  

That evening the three played a family: Joseph and Bella the parents, Lucy their daughter. She leaned against Bella and felt the warmth of her body. For an instant, Lucy forgot the weight of duty, the trap of her mother’s words. She belonged. She wanted it.  

But when the exercise ended, reality crashed back. Lucy clutched her books and whispered through gritted teeth:  
*“Tomorrow, I must study. I must.”*  

That night, her phone buzzed with a message from Joseph. Lucy’s body jolted as though struck. She threw the phone across the room, heart hammering, as though her mother herself had discovered her crime.  

For days she tried to bury improv again, drowning in assignments, clinging to the path her mother demanded. Yet the hunger remained.  

And one afternoon, months later, she stumbled across a stage set up in the campus square. Joseph and Bella were performing improv for a crowd.  

Joseph’s voice rang out: *“Bella!”* His gaze swept the audience, searching.  

Bella’s eyes followed, sharp as a hawk. Then she found Lucy.  

For three long seconds, Lucy could not move. Her body trembled, but her eyes locked onto Bella’s, terrified, enthralled. When Bella finally looked away, Lucy fled, her chest tight, her thoughts screaming.  

Back in her dorm, clutching her phone, she whispered through tears:  
*“Why won’t you let me go?”*  

And then, with shaking fingers, she reopened Joseph’s long-silent message.  

She typed, slowly, as though stepping across a line she could never return from:  

**“See you tomorrow.”**
