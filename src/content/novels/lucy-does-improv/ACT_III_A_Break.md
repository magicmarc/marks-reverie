The morning after her last class with Catherine, Lucy woke refreshed. She had finished the semester with strong grades, earned nods of approval from her professors, and—against all odds—made friends in the improv club. For once, the two halves of her life did not seem irreconcilable.  

On the train home for summer, she idly scrolled through Instagram. First Joseph’s page: group photos of the club, Bella laughing, Joseph unexpectedly in a suit—“Bachelor of Finance,” the caption read. Lucy blinked, surprised; she had always assumed him a sports or arts major. There were city streets, stray cats, little glimpses of another life.

## Bella’s Profile

Then Bella’s page. Lucy’s breath caught.

Post after post unfolded like a world Lucy had never dared imagine. In one video, Bella barked commands in a spin class, sweat flinging from her brow, her hair plastered to her face, her voice hoarse with laughter as she shouted: “Faster! Louder! Feel your heart burn!” The students in the background looked half-exhausted, half-drunk on her energy. Lucy could almost hear the thrum of the music, the pounding of bodies, the reckless joy of someone unafraid to take up space.

Another photo showed Bella in a cocktail dress, glittering sequins catching every shard of light. She tilted her head back, laughing with a champagne flute in her hand, surrounded by men and women who looked at her as though she were the only person alive. There was nothing demure about her smile—it was sharp, daring, as if she knew exactly how much power she carried in her body and didn’t care who noticed.

Further down, an image of Bella caught mid-leap in a ballet studio: her back arched, her skirt flying, one hand reaching for something just out of frame. It wasn’t graceful in the polished, competition sense—it was feral, raw, almost dangerous. The caption read only: “Falling is part of it.”

There were camping pictures too—Bella sprawled by the fire in ripped jeans, hair tangled, a bottle of beer in hand, eyes glittering with mischief as if she had just dared someone to jump into the lake at midnight.

And then—the one Lucy could not forget. Bella on a bed, sprawled in an oversized white shirt, collar slipping loose, hair wild across her shoulders. No caption, no explanation, just the directness of the image itself. It was not coy. It was not posed. It radiated a kind of unstudied defiance, as though Bella were saying: Here I am. Look if you dare.

Lucy stared at the screen, dazed. Her own photos—carefully framed, polite smiles, neat clothes—suddenly seemed like something from another species. She hugged her books tighter to her chest, even as the images clung to her like perfume, intoxicating and inescapable.

That evening, with her parents cooking in the kitchen, Lucy retreated to her room. She connected her phone to the speaker, let jaunty jazz fill the air, and tried—awkwardly, timidly at first—to step into Bella’s world.

For the first time, she dared to improvise alone. She imagined herself a hard-nosed investment banker, issuing orders to invisible subordinates. Then a stray cat, mewling with dramatic flair. Then Bella’s images became her cues: a gym trainer pounding push-ups, a dazzling socialite raising her glass, and finally—hesitantly—Bella on the bed in the white shirt.

Lucy tried to inhabit the scene, to channel its mystery and seduction. But she could not shake the sense that she was playing with fire, tasting a life too wild for her to hold. And yet she laughed, flushed, unable to stop—because for those moments, it felt like the only time she was most like herself.

## A Family-Friendly Conversation

At dinner she spoke proudly of her grades, her activities, her new friends.

Her father smiled. “Sounds like you had a good semester.”

Her mother’s face tightened. “You have ten fingers, Lucy. You can only kill ten flies at once. Extra clubs are a distraction.”

“But right now, there are only two flies,” Lucy countered lightly, forcing a smile.

“Don’t argue. Especially performance—it doesn’t suit you.” She turned to her husband. “Isn’t that right?”

Her father hesitated, then nodded gently, voice calm as if to soften the blow. “You’ve always been a good daughter—patient, studious. Perfect for accounting. Performance requires a different kind of person, someone bold, outspoken. Maybe it’s not your path.”

Lucy pressed her lips together. “But I could learn.”

Her father leaned closer, as though soothing a frightened child. “Lucy, you’ve always been sensitive. That’s not a weakness, it just means we must protect you. Think about the stress, the crowds, the exposure—those things could hurt you. Why risk it?”

His tone was soft, almost kind, but it settled on her like a diagnosis. Lucy felt the air thicken.

“I’m not fragile,” she whispered, though even as she said it, the words quivered.

He smiled sadly, a doctor with a patient he could not cure. “Maybe it’s destiny. Look at Amy next door—she can mimic Lady Gaga, Madonna, anyone. Could you?”

“I could!” Lucy said, her voice rising too fast, too thin.

“Then sing Bad Romance.”

Lucy swallowed, throat tightening. She half-sang, half-mumbled: “Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma…”

Her voice cracked, raw and thin. The table fell silent. Her cheeks burned with shame.

“See?” her father said gently, almost pitying. “We should do what suits us. Your mother just doesn’t want your talents wasted.”

Her mother reached across the table, patting Lucy’s hand as though she were ill, not grown. “We know what’s best for you.”

Lucy dropped her gaze, her breath shallow. The weight pressing into her shoulders was not just disappointment—it was the suffocating sense of being contained, like glass walls had been built around her. She was not their daughter; she was their patient, forever in treatment, forever unwell in their eyes.

## Memories of Another Dream

That night, Lucy buried her face in her pillow, tears seeping hot and silent. If only she had Bella’s poise, Bella’s gifts, perhaps then she could be more than this.  

Sleep took her.  

She dreamed she was running along a Nordic lake, water shimmering in the dusk. On the shore lay a glinting stone. She picked it up, carved a leaf into the wall of her house. Her father appeared, not angry but careful, wiping the mark away.  

“Papa, don’t,” she cried. “It’s beautiful.”  

“Lucy, love,” he said gently, “if the wall is dirty, Mama will be upset.”  

She tried to stop him, her small hands gripping his, but his strength was steady, unyielding.  

“Don’t cry,” he whispered. “I’ll buy you ice cream. As much as you want. My job is to keep you and Mama happy.”  

Lucy’s sobs echoed against the wall, as the carved leaf disappeared beneath his cloth.

## Curtain  

She woke with her pillow damp, her chest tight. Outside, the house was quiet, the same house she had grown up in. She wiped her eyes and told herself she would study harder in the morning. She would be sensible. She would be—what everyone already believed her to be.  

She would be a good daughter.
