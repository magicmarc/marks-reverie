The morning after her last class with Catherine, Lucy woke refreshed. She had finished the semester with strong grades, earned nods of approval from her professors, and—against all odds—made friends in the improv club.

On the train home for summer, Lucy leaned against the window, phone in hand, thumbing through Instagram. The first profile she tapped was Joseph’s.

## Joseph’s Profile

The feed startled her.

Not the booming landlord, not the boy who commanded a room with laughter—but a student, as ordinary as any she had sat beside in lecture halls. Group photos of the Improv Club, yes, but between them: Joseph in a crisp suit at some award night, captioned “Bachelor of Finance.” Lucy blinked; she had always imagined him a theatre kid, or maybe an athlete. Finance. He looked… serious, his tie slightly crooked, smiling in that restrained, professional way.

She swiped further. Grainy snapshots of city streets at dusk, a stray cat crouched beneath a motorbike, a half-empty coffee cup beside an open laptop. Little fragments, mundane and unpolished, like peeking into a private drawer.

Lucy paused, unsettled. For the first time she saw him not only as the exuberant president of the Improv Club, but as a boy with deadlines, commutes, maybe even doubts. A boy living a parallel life, not so different from hers.

## Bella’s Profile

Then Bella’s page. Lucy’s breath caught.

Post after post unfolded like a world Lucy had never dared imagine. One photo showed Bella in a gym - leggings, a tank top, her hair damp with sweat as she gripped the handlebars of a spin bike. The background was cluttered with mirrors and neon lights, other students pedaling in blurred focus.

From that picutre, somehow Lucy heard Bella’s voice, sharp and hoarse with laughter, barking orders over pounding music: “Faster! Louder! Feel your heart burn!” In her imagination, sweat flew from Bella’s brow like sparks, her energy so wild it intoxicated the room. 

Another photo showed Bella in a cocktail dress, glittering sequins catching every shard of light. She tilted her head back, laughing with a champagne flute in her hand, surrounded by men and women who looked at her. 

"Who are you, Bella." Lucy couldn't help but asking.

There were camping pictures too—Bella sprawled by the fire in ripped jeans, hair tangled, eyes glittering with mischief as if she had just dared someone to jump into the lake at midnight.

And then—the one Lucy could not forget. Bella on a bed, sprawled in an oversized white shirt, collar slipping loose, hair wild across her shoulders. No caption, no explanation, just the directness of the image itself. It was not coy. It was not posed. It radiated a kind of unstudied defiance, as though Bella were saying: Here I am. Look if you dare.

Lucy stared at the screen, dazed. Her own photos—carefully framed, polite smiles, neat clothes—suddenly seemed like something from another universe. Bella's images clung to her like perfume, intoxicating and inescapable.

## Bedroom Improv

That evening, with her parents cooking in the kitchen, Lucy retreated to her room. She connected her phone to the speaker, let jaunty jazz fill the air, and tried—awkwardly, timidly at first—to step into Joseph, and *Bella’s* world.

For the first time, she dared to improvise alone. 

She imagined herself as Joseph after graduation,a hard-nosed investment banker, issuing orders to invisible subordinates. Then a stray cat, mewling with dramatic flair. 

Later, Bella’s images became her cues: a gym trainer pounding push-ups, a dazzling socialite raising her glass, and finally—hesitantly—Bella on the bed in the white shirt.

Lucy scrolled back to the photo—the one she couldn’t forget. Bella sprawled across a bed in an oversized white shirt, collar slipping from her shoulder, hair untamed, gaze direct, as if daring the camera to flinch.

Lucy stood before her mirror, heart hammering. She tugged at her own shirt, pulling it loose at the collar, exposing more of her collarbone than she ever had. She let her hair down, shook it out, though it fell flat, obedient rather than wild.

She tried to drape herself on the bed the way Bella had, stretching one arm above her head, tilting her chin toward an imaginary lens. At once she felt ridiculous. Her back stiffened, her legs at odd angles, her expression caught between pout and grimace. She let out a strangled laugh, half-mortified, half-thrilled.

Then she tried again. She lowered her eyes, parted her lips slightly, tracing the outline of Bella’s expression. The image in the mirror stared back at her—not Bella, not quite Lucy either, but someone in between. Someone braver, someone she might have been if shame were not stitched into her skin.

Her cheeks burned hot, but she couldn’t look away. For the first time, she felt the strange intoxication of performing not for others, but for herself.

## A Family-Friendly Conversation

The dining room. Warm light. The smell of braised pork and steamed rice lingers. Lucy sits straight-backed, hands folded, eager to share her semester’s triumphs. Her parents face her across the table. The air feels both homely and suffocating.

Lucy (brightly): I did well this semester. My professors praised my work, and I even made some new friends—

Mother (interrupting, coldly measured): You have ten fingers, Lucy. Ten fingers kill ten flies at once. Anything beyond that—clubs, activities—is excess.

Lucy (forcing a smile): But there are only two flies right now.

Mother (snaps): Don’t argue. Especially not about performance—it doesn’t suit you. (She turns to Father.) Isn’t that right?

Father (hesitant, soft): Well… Lucy’s grades are good. Meeting more friends can be good for her.

Mother (pressing, voice sharp): Friends, yes. But performance? Do you know what kind of people actors are? Do you know what kind of life they live?

Lucy (blurts, desperate): They’re the people I feel most connected to!

Mother (ignores Lucy, to Father): You know her condition. She’s not suited for this. If she were healthy, perhaps. But as she is—

Father (sighs, gentle, almost pleading): Don’t mention that at the table. The doctor warned us. And she’s been off medication for months. She managed her classes, even made friends. Isn’t that enough?

Mother (lowers her voice, cutting): I saw what she was doing in her room. I didn’t like it.

(She finally turns to Lucy, eyes narrowing.)

Mother: The entertainment world is filthy. Actresses are used, coerced, forced into beds with old men.

Lucy (shakes her head, flustered): Actresses? No, no, I never thought of that. Improv is different—it’s not television or cinema, it’s just… fun.

Mother (to Father, dismissing Lucy): Speak to her.

Father (leans forward, soothing tone, almost paternal): Your mother may be right. Perhaps performance isn’t your path. You’ve always been such a good daughter—diligent, patient. Perfect for accounting, where steadiness is needed. Performance requires boldness, extroversion. Perhaps you’re not built for it.

Lucy (voice cracks, but firm): But I can learn! I want to do something different! Don't we call that one's development in personality?

Father (soft smile, cruel in its certainty): Maybe there's something we were born with. Look at little Amy next door—so outgoing. She can mimic Lady Gaga, Madonna—flawless. Can you?

Lucy (defiant, trembling): I can!

Father (gently, like a test): Then sing Bad Romance.

(Lucy swallows. She opens her mouth, voice thin and uneven.)

Lucy (murmurs, broken): Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah… Roma-roma-ma…

(Her voice falters, cracks. The room falls silent. Her cheeks burn crimson. She lowers her head, ashamed, hating the sound of herself.)

Father (patting her hand, kindly, devastatingly): See? We must do what suits us. Be clever. Don’t waste your gifts. Your mother only wants to protect you.

(Lucy does not reply. She keeps her head bowed, spoon moving mechanically to her lips, chewing without tasting. The silence presses in. She looks small, smaller than she is, like a patient being fed at the table of her own home.)

## Memories of Another Dream

That night, Lucy buried her face in her pillow, tears seeping hot and silent. If only she had Bella’s poise, Bella’s gifts, perhaps then she could be more than this.  

Sleep took her.  

She dreamed she was running along a Nordic lake, water shimmering in the dusk. On the shore lay a glinting stone. She picked it up, carved a leaf into the wall of her house. Her father appeared, not angry but careful, wiping the mark away.  

“Papa, don’t,” she cried. “It’s beautiful.”  

“Lucy, love,” he said gently, “if the wall is dirty, Mama will be upset.”  

She tried to stop him, her small hands gripping his, but his strength was steady, unyielding.  

“Don’t cry,” he whispered. “I’ll buy you ice cream. As much as you want. My job is to keep you and Mama both happy.”  

Lucy’s sobs echoed against the wall, as the carved leaf disappeared.

## Curtain  

She woke with her pillow damp, her chest tight. Outside, the house was quiet, the same house she had grown up in. She wiped her eyes and told herself she would be sensible. She would be—what everyone already believed her to be.  

She would be a good daughter.

Lucy was well-rested during this break, and ready for school again.
