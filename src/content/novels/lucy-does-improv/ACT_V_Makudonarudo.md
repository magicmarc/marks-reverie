Lucy had grown older, though she hardly noticed when it began. University had blurred into memory, like a dream that revisited her at night but left her waking hours empty. She worked now as an auditing consultant, promoted quietly, steadily, nothing flashy.  

Her diary from those years was thin. At school she had recorded every little episode—Joseph’s laughter, Bella’s earrings, Catherine’s guiding hand. But of her work there was almost nothing. It was as though her mind refused to make room for ledgers and client accounts. She lived those days diligently, yet when she dreamed, she was always a student still.

## Park 

One night, she and Park worked late on a financial report for a client. Stacks of papers, the glow of monitors, the city already asleep outside.  

Lucy insisted on adding commentary to the report.  
“This is how we’d lose marks in class if we left it out.”  

Park frowned, sharp.  
“You’re still thinking like a student. This isn’t homework—this is business.”  

“I don’t feel right leaving it.”  

Park sighed, voice both weary and mocking.  
“Lucy, Lucy, our dear Lucy. This isn’t school. We’re on a chessboard now, and you have to play by the rules of the game.”  

“What chessboard? You sound insane!”  

Park threw up his hands. “Fine. Do what you want. I’m done.” He slammed the file shut and stormed out.  

Lucy stayed. She knelt to gather the scattered pages, smoothing each one with trembling hands. She checked every figure, every line, rebuilt the report until dawn. At eight a.m., exhausted but certain, she sent it to the client herself.

## Veronica  

Later that morning, Lucy caught a glimpse through the glass wall: Veronica, their boss, face flushed as she shouted into the phone. Then—bang—the receiver slammed down.  

“Park! Lucy! Get in here!”  

They shuffled into the office like guilty schoolchildren.  

“Who did the report?” Veronica barked.  

“Lucy,” Park said at once. “I didn’t touch it.”  

“You didn’t check it either, did you?!” Veronica snapped back.  

“She never listens to me.”  

Veronica turned, eyes blazing. “Lucy, do you even know what you were doing? What kind of third-rate school taught you this?”  

Lucy’s voice shook. “Wasn’t… wasn’t it supposed to be this way?”  

The desk shook under Veronica’s palm as she slammed it. Lucy flinched. Only then did doubt stab her—perhaps Park was right, perhaps the perfect report she slaved over was flawed from the start.  

“Get out,” Veronica hissed. “Both of you. I need to calm down.”

## Making Peace 

That evening, Veronica invited them to dinner. Her face was serene now, almost kind, as if the storm in her office had never happened.  

Over red wine she smiled at them both.  
“You are talented, both of you. But talent without teamwork is useless. You must learn to work together.”  

Lucy whispered, “I’m sorry, boss. It was my fault.”  

Park added his own apology, casual, self-assured: “It won’t happen again.”  

Veronica nodded. “Everyone makes mistakes. But if you cling to them, if you refuse to change, then you cannot stay. Do you understand?”  

Her voice was soft, but each word pierced Lucy’s chest. Tears pricked her eyes. She had thought her report flawless. Now it seemed nothing but a failure.  

Park was quick to answer. “Yes, boss. I understand.”  

Veronica’s lips curved into satisfaction. Then she turned to Lucy.  
“And you, Lucy?”  

Lucy forced her voice steady. “Yes, madam.”  

The three dined as though nothing had happened. Yet Lucy’s heart was a storm of shame and confusion. She longed for the certainty of school days, when a mistake came marked in red, visible, fixable. Here, she could not even tell what she had done wrong.

## Makudonarudo  

That night, alone in her rented room, Lucy pulled out the report she had sent the client. She traced each line, each number, as though red ink might appear on its own. None did. Her hand shook.  

She wanted to call Park, to demand answers, but couldn’t bring herself to dial. She gripped the papers until her knuckles whitened, her whole body trembling.  

To distract herself, she opened YouTube. A playlist shuffled, and then—unexpectedly—a song filled her room.  

“Makudonarudo…”  

She froze. It was Namewee’s song, a parody she had once laughed at in passing. But now the words struck like triggers:  

**Makudonarudo** —She found herself miming a greedy bite into an invisible burger.  
**Guguru Toiletto** —She stumbled around, frantic, searching for a toilet in a maze-like mall.  
**Kitto Katto** —She pretended to unwrap chocolate, eyes melting into sweetness, cheeks flushing as if receiving it from a secret lover.  
**Dizunirando** —She rode an imaginary carousel, laughing with a girlish delight she had long buried.  
**Kōhī Kēki. Aisukurīmu Konbini.** —She played a shop girl in a convenience store, eager, breathless, selling coffee, cake, ice cream, every gesture exaggerated, ridiculous, alive.  

The music whipped her into motion. She lost control, every lyric a cue, every beat a command. She was no longer in her room but back in the rehearsal space, back in the freedom she had denied herself.  

At the final shout—  

**“Ba-ka-ya-ro-u!”**  

Lucy screamed it too, at herself.  
“Baka yarō! Stupid Lucy! Fool!”  

Her voice cracked, tears streaming. She laughed and sobbed, collapsing onto the bed.  

The relapse had come. Improv had claimed her again.
