Lucy woke with her head pounding, too drained to think of correcting the report. She called in sick, surrender in her voice as she phoned Park.  

“Park, I messed up. Could you… help me? I really don’t feel well today.”  

“The report, right? Don’t worry,” Park said, his voice softer than she expected. “Rest. I’ll fix it.”  

For the first time, Lucy felt he wasn’t an enemy. Not quite a friend either—not the shallow kind she’d known in school—but something more complicated, belonging to the adult world.  

Flat on her bed, Lucy wondered: if she had already failed, then why not do what she truly wanted?  

And in a whisper, she admitted it to herself: *I want to find Bella.*

## Bella’s Profile  

She reopened Bella’s Instagram, the account she had once muted. The girl she had once wanted to become.  

But what she saw chilled her.  

No gym selfies, no cocktail dresses. Even the white-shirt photo was gone. In its place: a heavier woman, slightly older, cradling two children—one in kindergarten, one still an infant.  

Lucy scrolled in a frenzy, searching for the Bella she remembered. Instead, she found a wedding portrait: Bella beside an unremarkable man, plain-faced, almost homely. Only after staring did Lucy recognise her—the tilt of her smile, softened now, worn with care. The rebellion had faded into a kind of weary tenderness.  

Lucy looked in the mirror and startled herself. She too had aged. Yet the outline of that girl from years ago still lingered.  

Her hand hovered over the message button. But every word felt like an intrusion. She closed the app.

## Joseph’s Profile  

With unease still in her chest, Lucy searched for Joseph.  

His page was the opposite—alive with videos. He was now a content creator, broadcasting advice on loans, insurance, investment products. Between pitches, he flashed his muscles, shirtless and grinning. He looked younger than ever, even sharper, his speech quick and playful. Years of improv echoed in his timing—each joke landing neatly, his rhythm effortless.  

The likes and comments piled by the thousands.  

And yet, nestled among the glossy reels, the old photos remained: the stray cat, the city streets, the suit and tie, and finally, the group photo of the Improv Club.  

There was Bella again—her hair streaked with rebellion, earrings catching the light, a face at once highborn and wild.  

Lucy’s breath caught. That Bella was gone. Joseph remained—but she could not bear to contact him.  

What she wanted was something else. Something she had buried for years: *Catherine’s class.*

## Catherine’s Class  

She searched desperately online. No Instagram, but a faint address surfaced—a small studio. Heart pounding, Lucy dressed in her old workout clothes, as if her body remembered before her mind could decide, and took a taxi there.  

The studio was real. And inside—Catherine.  

Her hair was white now, but her posture straight, her eyes sharp, the soul still burning. She was teaching children, little ones in animal costumes, their voices bright and eager.  

“Catherine!” Lucy blurted.  

Catherine froze, then broke into recognition. “Lucy, isn’t it?”  

Lucy was stunned—her teacher remembered.  

At the break, she approached. “Do you still teach improv? It seems this is for children.”  

“Not many adults come anymore,” Catherine said gently. “The economy is harsh, companies demand more. Grown-ups don’t have time. But for immigrant children, drama helps them learn English. That’s what I teach nowadays.”  

A shadow crossed Lucy’s face.  

“But you can join us,” Catherine added, eyes twinkling. “We’re short one helper. Would you play Boots?”  

Lucy’s lips trembled. “…Dora the Explorer?”  

Catherine smiled. “Exactly.”

## Dora the Explorer  

The room filled with children, tiny animals skipping, giggling. Lucy slipped into the monkey costume, ridiculous yet strangely comforting.  

“Today,” Catherine announced, “we play *Dora Plays the Doctor!*”  

The girl playing Dora skipped forward, twin braids bouncing, a toy stethoscope swinging from her neck. She pressed it against Lucy’s leg. “Is Boots’s heart here?” she asked the class.  

“Nooo!” the little animals chorused.  

She pressed it to Lucy’s arm. “Is Boots’s heart here?”  

The touch jolted Lucy—sudden, electric. She remembered Bella’s hand years ago, guiding her into motion.  

Her eyes blurred.  

Then Dora pressed it to her chest. “Is Boots’s heart here?”  

Lucy’s breath broke. Tears welled. She seized the child’s hand, dragging the stethoscope to her heart. “It’s here! My heart is here! Do you hear it?”  

The girl blinked, startled but kind. “Yes. I can hear it.”  

“Is Boots’s heart here?” she asked the others.  

“Yes!” the little animals shouted. “That’s Boots’s heart!”  

Lucy saw Catherine at the edge of her vision, rising, as if to stop the scene—but then she paused, and let it unfold.  

A boy in a fox costume, meant to play Swiper, piped up. But instead of slyness he said earnestly, “Don’t worry, Boots. Dora is a doctor. She’ll heal you.”  

Lucy could no longer hold back. She pulled Dora and Swiper into her arms, sobbing, laughing.

The other children rushed in, a tide of warmth, wrapping their arms around her.  

(Children crowd around her, arms wrapping her like a tide. Lucy, tears streaking her face, rises slightly, lifting her voice as though addressing not only the children, but the unseen audience beyond the fourth wall.)

Lucy (voice breaking, then steady):
“My heart is here. It has always been here. Not in numbers, not in silence, not in the roles they wrote for me - 
but in this moment, in this play -

I am Boots but I am also Lucy.
And I do improv with a heart.”

(The children cheer, their voices swelling. Catherine watches from the edge, smiling through her own tears. The lights dim, leaving Lucy in a single spotlight, her chest heaving, her eyes lifted, as though she has finally stepped onto the stage of her own life.)
