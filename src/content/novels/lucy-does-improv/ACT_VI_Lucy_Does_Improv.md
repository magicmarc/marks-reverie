Lucy woke with her head pounding, too drained to think of correcting the report. She called in sick, surrender in her voice as she phoned Park.  

“Park, I messed up. Could you… help me? I really don’t feel well today.”  

“The report, right? Don’t worry,” Park said, his voice softer than she expected. “Rest. I’ll fix it.”  

For the first time, Lucy felt he wasn’t an enemy. Not quite a friend either—not the shallow kind she’d known in school—but something more complicated, belonging to the adult world.  

A laugh escaped her, brittle but real. Her world was ruined already. So why not break the last rule, the one she had always tiptoed around?

She turned her face into the pillow and whispered, almost daring herself: *I want to find Bella.*

## Bella’s Profile  

She reopened Bella’s Instagram, the account she had once muted. The girl she had once wanted to become.  

But what she saw chilled her.  

No gym selfies, no cocktail dresses. Even the sexy white-shirt photo was gone. In its place was a woman, who cradled two children—one already in kindergarten, the other still an infant—her smile gentle but worn, as though stretched thin by sleepless nights. 

Lucy scrolled in a frenzy, searching for the Bella she remembered. Instead, she found a wedding portrait: Bella beside a man, plain-faced, almost homely. Only after staring did Lucy recognise her—the tilt of her smile, softened now, worn with care. The rebellion had faded into a kind of weary tenderness.  

"Who the hell are you, Bella?" she asked the same question once again.

Lucy looked in the mirror and startled herself. She too had aged. Yet the outline of that girl from years ago still lingered.  

Her hand hovered over the message button. But every word felt like an intrusion. She closed the app.

## Joseph’s Profile  

With unease still in her chest, Lucy searched for Joseph.

His page was the opposite—alive with videos. He was now a content creator, broadcasting advice on loans, insurance, investment products. Between pitches, he flexed and laughed, flashing muscles, grinning wide for the camera. His speech was quick, playful, practiced; years of improv honed his timing so every joke landed, every gesture slid neatly into rhythm.

The likes and comments piled. Joseph looked younger than ever, yet sharper, polished into a brand.

Lucy scrolled, unsettled. This Joseph no longer felt like someone she could sit beside in a circle, trading lines in the silly comfort of improv. The easy boyishness she had once seen in him was gone—or perhaps it had never been real. Maybe Joseph had always been this: mature, confident, moving forward without looking back.

Nestled among the glossy reels, though, the old photos remained: the stray cat, the city streets, the suit and tie "Bachelor of Finance", and finally, the group photo of the Improv Club.

There was Bella again—hair streaked with rebellion, silver earrings catching the light, a face both highborn and wild.

Lucy’s breath caught. That Bella was gone. Joseph remained—but he was no longer hers to know.

What she wanted was something else. Something she had buried for years: *Catherine’s class*.

## Catherine’s Class  

She searched desperately online. No Instagram, but a faint address surfaced—a small studio. Heart pounding, Lucy dressed in her old workout clothes, as if her body remembered before her mind could decide, and took a taxi there.  

The studio was real. And inside—Catherine.  

Her hair was white now, but her posture straight, her eyes sharp, the soul still burning. She was teaching children, little ones in animal costumes, their voices bright and eager.  

“Catherine!” Lucy blurted.  

Catherine froze, then broke into recognition. “Lucy, isn’t it?”  

Lucy was stunned—her teacher remembered.  

At the break, she approached. “Do you still teach improv? It seems this class is for children now.”  

“Not many adults come anymore,” Catherine said gently. “The economy is harsh, companies demand more. Grown-ups don’t have time. But for immigrant children, drama helps them learn English. This is what I teach nowadays.”  

A shadow crossed Lucy’s face.  

“But you can join us,” Catherine added, eyes twinkling. “We’re short one helper. Would you play Boots?”  

Lucy’s lips trembled. “…Dora the Explorer?”  

Catherine smiled. “Exactly.”

## Dora the Explorer  

The room filled with children, tiny animals skipping, giggling. Lucy slipped into the monkey costume, ridiculous yet strangely comforting.  

“Today,” Catherine announced, “we play *Dora Plays the Doctor!*”  

The girl playing Dora skipped forward, twin braids bouncing, a toy stethoscope swinging from her neck. She pressed it against Lucy’s leg. “Is Boots’s heart here?” she asked the class.  

“Nooo!” the little animals chorused.  

She pressed it to Lucy’s arm. “Is Boots’s heart here?”  

The touch jolted Lucy—sudden, electric. She remembered Bella’s hand years ago, guiding her into motion.  

Her eyes blurred.  

Then Dora pressed it to her chest. “Is Boots’s heart here?”  

Lucy’s breath broke. Tears welled. She seized the child’s hand, dragging the stethoscope to her heart. “It’s here! My heart is here! Do you hear it? Can you feel it?! ”  

The girl blinked, startled but kind. “Yes. I can hear it.”  

“Is Boots’s heart here?” she asked the others.  

“Yes!” the little animals shouted. “That’s Boots’s heart!”  

Lucy saw Catherine at the edge of her vision, rising, as if to stop the scene—but then she paused, and let it unfold.  

A boy in a fox costume, meant to play Swiper, piped up. But instead of slyness he said earnestly, “Don’t worry, Boots. Dora is a doctor. She’ll heal you.”  

Lucy could no longer hold back. She pulled Dora and Swiper into her arms, sobbing, laughing.

Children crowd around her, arms wrapping her like a tide. Lucy, tears streaking her face, clutches the stethoscope against her chest. She looks down at the girl playing Dora, then—slowly—she raises her head, her voice trembling but gathering strength.

Lucy (as Boots, but also as herself):
"My heart… it’s *here*. You can hear it, can’t you? It beats. It beats because it's *real*."

At the edge, Catherine watches, her eyes wet, her smile proud.

The lights dim. Lucy stands in the middle of the circle, chest heaving, tears shining, as if she has truly stepped into her own stage.
